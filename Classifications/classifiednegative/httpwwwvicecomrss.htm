	Police horses vs. student protesters on the 9th December 2010  (Photo by Henry Langston)
</p><p><em>This post originally appeared on VICE UK.</em></p><p>
	Last Wednesday, PC Andrew Ott, a police evidence gatherer, was
sentenced to eight months in prison for Actual Bodily Harm against student
protester Will Horner. For all the rampaging, horse-charging, baton-flailing police brutality meted out at all of the
late-2010 UK student protests, this is the first and so far only time a police officer has been convicted for
any offenses.

	The typical narrative of the demonstration on the 9th of
December, the evening of the parliamentary vote to triple the cap on tuition
fees, concentrates on violence from protesters. It was protesters who provoked
a kettle in Parliament Square. It was protesters who attacked police with
missiles, and it was protesters who attacked the treasury building.
</p><p>
	As an
evidence gatherer on that day, it was PC Ott's role to prove some of this
criminal behavior. He was equipped with a recording device to log just this
kind of protester violence. But a small electrical fault, that led him to
believe it was inoperable when in actuality it was working just fine, meant that he inadvertently gathered the "wrong" kind of evidence—which you can listen to 
	<a href="http://www.defendtherighttoprotest.org/police-on-trial-for-2010-student-fees-protests-ipcc-release-audio-recording/" target="_blank">here</a>—the sort that said less about protester violence and much more about police
brutality.</p><p class="normal pullquote">
	I've had enough of these cunts, I just fucking hit him.</p><p>A jury at Southwark Crown Court found Ott guilty after hearing
the audio evidence. He is heard saying after knocking out Horner's tooth, "not
me mate, you slipped on the metal fence." It had actually been Ott's riot
shield that caused the injury, he later admitted. His own recording device also
picks up such telling nuggets as: "I've had enough of these cunts, I just
fucking hit him"; "I wanna kill this little lot here, mate. If that fence goes,
I'm going to f****** batter them"; and "I've clouted a few as well, just to get
a bit of justice." Y'know – standard riot-cop banter.
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="normal">
	There has been little justice for protesters caught in that
kettle in the winter of 2010. Anyone who was there can attest to the utter
relentlessness of brutality, sustained for many hours. It all culminated in a
crush of protesters on Westminster Bridge. At the end of the audio linked above
you can hear people screaming that they fear they might die.
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="normal">
	Alfie Meadows, who was then a 20-year-old student very nearly
did die after a police baton strike to the head required him to have lifesaving
brain surgery. They then later charged him with violent disorder, of which is
he was acquitted after nearly three years. 
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="normal">
	Other protesting students weren't so lucky, going to prison for
lengthy jail terms after being charged with "violent disorder." Many of these
crimes were against property, such as the smashed windows of Milbank Tower. Their
sentences were much heavier than that PC Ott now faces.
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="normal">
	The audio evidence that meant Ott was prosecuted gives a
snapshot of his violent approach toward policing, but he appears not to have been the only one. Often he was speaking to other cops when he made threats and this
kind of chat didn't seem to attract any negative reaction.
</p><!--recommended--><p>
	In fact, a whole
section of the recording details how other police saw Will Horner as having
done nothing wrong and Ott then proceeding to coax some kind of excuse for
arrest out of them in order to account for his violent use of force. Some of the other
officers oblige, one saying, "I forgot to tell you what happened, as he has jumped over there he has said: 'I'm going to fucking smash up that building.'" Ott replied: "Perfect."
</p><p>
	And why wouldn't they? They had spent the day repressing the protest. To them Will Horner was no different to the other
demonstrators.
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="normal">
	Given the scale of cracked skulls, broken bones, and bruising
after being subjected to horse charges, baton charges, and crushing kettling, it
is hard to pretend Ott is an exception. He was just stupid enough to get
himself caught. Ott's actions and words were vile, but they happened within a
context that saw public order policing having to happen this way. 
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="normal">
	With this in mind it is hard to feel much more than ambivalence
toward his custodial sentence. Sure he acted heinously, but the reality is that the
whole damn system acted heinously and continues to do so. The worry is that
this individual conviction will be used to absolve the police more widely—used to show that the police are in fact accountable. Another possibility is that this
conviction can pierce the myth of violent-protestor/victim-cop. Perhaps it will
allow us to look with fresh eyes at how this summer's protests are policed and
to convince others that police are not infallible.

	On a little island off the north end of Vancouver Island, there used to be a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/9700188@N04/4680817951/in/photolist-qmDbG8-r221aR-qmE9Qa-rik1RR-qmsr3f-r1TRbo-ripdZ1-rijgHB-r1Zdze-riqibZ-qmG4Pz-rioRoL-r1TDU5-qmrcZ3-qmFstp-rirx2T-r1Tc8E-riknP2-rinDpY-rg7F8d-rinr5s-qZ6JvV-r23gxn-r1Ua9A-r1ZSTi-rimRMe-r1U8KL-r1TJqj-qmEEiD-r1UaSb-r1Vapy-r1Ufku-qZ8fER-r1TZRE-r1SE1N-r1SC6A-rimNPm-qmrZCs-qmGs7R-qmFTNx-r1UwHh-qmFnLt-riiKBe-bF8dan-bF8det-bsdjBY-bsdjtj-qZS569-88Cq6M-71Xiit" target="_blank">large brick building</a>, standing close to the beach. Four stories high and painted gleaming white, it was the first thing you saw from the ferry as it approached the village of Yalis.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	The second building you noticed was the Big House, a traditional gathering place for <a href="http://www.umista.org/masks_story/en/ht/potlatch01.html" target="_blank">potlatches</a> and other important ceremonies. Sitting up on a hill above the shore, its wide front is emblazoned with a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/davidstanleytravel/9411102177/in/photolist-fkCmNn-3M6Nd-q2bMhJ-ruwA53-5whnRc-5wmGWs-5wmH25-5wmGUf-5wmGPG-5wmGK1-5wmGYN-5whnzn-5wmGGA-5wmGBG-5whnuM-5wmGEw-5wmH4j-5whnhR-fkSw5d-4Qik69-8LbEMU-5fXpnr-4Qe6Sr-5gGsXk-9R4mgd-apKYx5-9e9Rsh-5Vsx7R-rJPvQG-ruwA1q-denoVd-8fwvFX-6idWX4-7ScLXL-7JcSmt-4x2x8T-5nY6b-kBzC6n-aj1CDk-5RfuuD-pWvnE8-sVekii-qDHPHe-sQ4bW3-na4zsJ-s8sXW-jKrn34-nyhjUR-ppbVJH-3cQcgC" target="_blank">bold, staring face</a>, with eyes gazing directly down at "St. Mike's."
</p><p>Between <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/relationships/histories/st-michaels-alert-bay" target="_blank">1929 and 1974</a>, St. Michael's Indian Residential School was home to thousands of kids enrolled in often year-round boarding school. Under the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/rcmp-herded-native-kids-to-residential-schools-1.992618" target="_blank">watchful eye of RCMP officers</a>, aboriginal parents were forced to give up their children as young as 4-years-old to Indian agents, or face possible fines or imprisonment. From tiny communities across the coast of BC, the children were brought into the cold, brick rooms of St. Mike's. Run by the Anglican church under the authority of the Indian Act, St. Mike's was where those little kids <a href="http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/residential-schools/" target="_blank">learned</a> that their <a href="http://indigenousfoundations.arts.ubc.ca/home/government-policy/the-residential-school-system.html" target="_blank">hair and bodies were disgusting</a>, that <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geography/chapter/4-4-case-study/" target="_blank">their families were demonic</a>, and that no amount of <a href="http://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2013/09/18/Break-Residential-Schools-Dark-Legacy-Understand-Why/" target="_blank">work</a>,  <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/the-wildly-depressing-history-of-canadian-residential-schools" target="_blank">physical</a> and <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/study-shows-residential-school-sex-abuse-has-generational-impact-284" target="_blank">sexual abuse</a>, or <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/news/finding-hildas-grave/3003619/" target="_blank">distance</a> from their backwards communities would cure them of the stain of Indian-ness.</p><p dir="ltr">
	I took that ferry recently, and someone asked me if I noticed that the paint was peeling on the bricks of the old residential school. "See, they tried to make us white," he chuckled, "But it didn't work—we're still red."</p><p dir="ltr">
	The last residential school in Canada closed its doors <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/relationships/histories/gordons-school-punnichy" target="_blank">in 1996</a>, in Punnichy, Saskatchewan. With it ended a system that ran over 100 years—one that was touted, in 1931, as "<a href="https://books.google.ca/books?id=xTmgAMJqfc4C&amp;pg=PT100&amp;dq=%22final+solution%22+duncan+campbell+scott&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Lv9dVfSPC86dygSup4HQCQ&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">the final solution of our Indian problem</a>." Over 150,000 children attended residential schools between the 1860s and the 1990s, half of whom are still alive.</p><p dir="ltr">
	Many have <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/10/18/genocide-first-nations-aboriginals-canada-un_n_4123112.html" target="_blank">urged</a> the UN to classify the residential school system under the 1948 Genocide Convention. It seems to fall squarely within the boundaries, not only of the softer <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/paul-martin-accuses-residential-schools-of-cultural-genocide-1.1335199" target="_blank">cultural genocide</a>, but also as straight-up genocide, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide_Convention#Definition_of_genocide" target="_blank">the definition of which includes</a> "forcibly transferring children... with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group."</p><p dir="ltr">
	It was not lost on the architects of the residential school system that no aboriginal people meant <a href="http://unworthydominanceofregina.uregina.wikispaces.net/8+-+The+Story+of+Canada%27s+Indian+Residential+School+System" target="_blank">no troublesome treaties or aboriginal title</a>. As much as it was about cultural assimilation, it was about <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Kill-Indian-Save-Man-Residential/dp/0872864340" target="_blank">destroying the economic and political basis</a> of Indigenous existence.</p><p dir="ltr">
	By the start of the '90s, the apologies had already begun flowing in. In 1991, the Catholic Church <a href="http://www.cccb.ca/site/eng/media-room/files/2630-apology-on-residential-schools-by-the-catholic-church" target="_blank">apologized</a> for their part in running the schools with the federal government. The Anglican, Presbyterian, and United churches quickly followed suit. Mostly they adhered to the <a href="http://www.anglican.ca/relationships/apology/english" target="_blank">Anglican Archbishop's model</a>: "I am sorry, more than I can say, that we tried to remake you in our image, taking from you your language and the signs of your identity. I am sorry, more than I can say, that in our schools so many were abused physically, sexually, culturally, and emotionally."</p><p dir="ltr">
	A decade and a half later, in 2008, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC) <a href="http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=7" target="_blank">was established</a> as "a sincere indication and acknowledgement of the injustices and harms experienced by Aboriginal people and the need for continued healing."</p><p dir="ltr">
	The TRC was partly set up in response to the fact that, at that time, almost half of Canadians (<a href="http://www.nrsss.ca/IRSRC%20TRC%20National%20Survey%20Final%20Report.pdf" target="_blank">49 percent</a>) reported never having heard or read anything on the subject of Indian residential schools. This May 31, the commission will finally come to an end and many will be asking whether it has made a dent in that statistic.</p><p dir="ltr">
	Between 2009 and 2014, the bulk of the TRC's public work consisted of gathering witness testimony from residential school survivors and their families. This happened in community "Statement Gathering" events in all the provinces and territories, as well as seven large National Events in provincial capitals. Statements were given confidentially, in recorded "Sharing Circles," or directly to commissioners in front of audiences of up to 2,000 people and a webcast. By all accounts, these events were <a href="http://www.straight.com/news/428331/residential-school-survivors-share-their-stories-truth-and-reconciliation-event-vancouver" target="_blank">profoundly moving</a>.</p><p class="has-image">[body_image width='720' height='540' path='images/content-images/2015/05/21/' crop='images/content-images-crops/2015/05/21/' filename='canadas-truth-commission-on-residential-schools-is-coming-to-a-troubling-close-far-from-reconciliation-body-image-1432238341.jpg' id='58636']</p><p class="photo-credit">Photo by Arthur Dayu Dick.</p><p dir="ltr">
	Though all events were open to the public, attendance varied. In Vancouver, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/thousands-walk-for-reconciliation-in-vancouver-1.1864051" target="_blank">CBC News reported</a> that 10,000 people showed up in the rain for a Walk for Reconciliation. The last national event, hosted in Edmonton, boasted the <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/aboriginal/residential-school-survivors-event-draws-thousands-in-edmonton-1.2588752" target="_blank">highest turnout yet</a> and ended in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTeCaxT-rF4kKx_grkh8ZamIu7ecWiaKt" target="_blank">Idle No More–led march</a> on the legislature. It may be that the commission is ending just as it was gaining speed.</p><p dir="ltr">
	Next week, the Delta Ottawa <a href="http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=830" target="_blank">will host the closing events of the TRC</a>, and on June 2, its much-anticipated final report will be released. However, with the dates only recently announced, and most of it taking place between nine and four on Monday and Tuesday—workdays—it is unclear how many people will actually show up to this one.</p><p dir="ltr">
	One of the biggest questions will be whether Prime Minister Stephen Harper will be one of them. At previous events, Harper was repeatedly criticized for, among other concerns, his remark that Canada has "<a href="http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/derrick/2009/09/harper-denial-g20-canada-has-no-history-colonialism" target="_blank">no history of colonialism</a>," his <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/why-is-stephen-harper-ignoring-the-uns-push-to-investigate-missing-aboriginal-women" target="_blank">lack of regard</a> for <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/canadians-everywhere-are-protesting-against-harpers-apathy-towards-missing-aboriginal-women" target="_blank">missing and murdered indigenous women</a>, and Canada's <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2015/mar/03/documents-harper-pushing-first-nations-to-shelve-rights-buy-into-resource-rush" target="_blank">internationally condemned</a> coercive attempts to get First Nations communities to <a href="http://www.vice.com/en_us/read/anti-oil-activists-named-as-national-security-threats-respond-to-leaked-rcmp-report-968" target="_blank">participate in oil and gas development</a>. Indeed, the final ceremonial close to the TRC takes place at Rideau Hall on June 3 and is listed in the program as open only to "<a href="http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=846" target="_blank">invited guests</a>."</p><p dir="ltr">
	It is an appropriate end to a troubled commission. From the start, the TRC has been <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2010/07/23/no_truth_no_reconciliation_for_aging_residential_school_survivors.html" target="_blank">plagued by confusion</a>, particularly regarding its relationship with the federal government. One of the most common misconceptions about the TRC is that it was initiated by the government of Canada. In fact, it was part of the <a href="https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1332949137290/1332949312397" target="_blank">Indian Residential School Settlement Agreement</a>. But what is that?</p><p dir="ltr">
	In 2007, on behalf of the approximately 80,000 living former students, the Indian Residential School Survivors Society successfully sued the Government of Canada and the churches that operated the schools on their behalf. It took six years of negotiation, and remains <a href="https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1332939430258/1332939552554" target="_blank">the largest class-action lawsuit in Canadian history</a>. While the government agreed to the compensation, it was the former students themselves who insisted on a truth commission. In 2008, the TRC was established, drawing its budget from that overall settlement. In other words, as TRC Commissioner Justice Murray Sinclair <a href="http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/pdfs/TRC_UN_Speech_CMS_FINAL_April_27_2010.pdf" target="_blank">put it</a>, "The Commission functions with survivor money."</p><p dir="ltr">
	The relationship between Ottawa and the TRC has remained tense from the start. By 2009, all three original commissioners had stepped down. <a href="http://www.canada.com/ottawacitizen/story.html?id=0d8ed93e-168f-47da-9b59-21ea9cc874c1" target="_blank">They cited</a>, among other concerns, an objection to ongoing meddling from the federal government. When Sinclair took the helm, along with commissioners Marie Wilson and Wilton Littlechild, one of their first acts was to <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/at-reconciliation-commission-key-positions-remain-unfilled/article4313620/" target="_blank">move the headquarters</a> from Ottawa to Winnipeg.</p><p dir="ltr">
	The <a href="http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=580" target="_blank">TRC's Interim Report</a>, released in 2010, was openly critical of the federal government, which it was forced to <a href="http://aptn.ca/news/2013/04/30/trc-ready-to-again-take-residential-school-document-fight-with-ottawa-to-court/" target="_blank">take to court twice</a> over access to archival documents (<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ottawa-ordered-to-provide-all-residential-schools-documents-1.1345892" target="_blank">it won both times</a>). The commission described the federal government's "reluctance to cooperate" as "unacceptable." Last year, Commissioner Sinclair <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/truth-is-hard-but-residential-school-reconciliation-harder-murray-sinclair-1.2819931" target="_blank">delivered a lecture</a> actually titled, "If you thought the truth was hard, reconciliation will be harder."</p><p dir="ltr">
	As the years passed, the questions persisted even as the events drew larger crowds: What was this truth commission? Who did it belong to? Who was it for?</p><p class="has-image">[body_image width='960' height='629' path='images/content-images/2015/05/21/' crop='images/content-images-crops/2015/05/21/' filename='canadas-truth-commission-on-residential-schools-is-coming-to-a-troubling-close-far-from-reconciliation-body-image-1432238410.jpg' id='58638']</p><p class="photo-credit">Photo by Arthur Dayu Dick.</p><p dir="ltr">
	Some <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/canada-s-truth-commission-learned-from-mandela-says-head-1.2454851" target="_blank">looked to the South African TRC</a> as a model for understanding our truth commission, and found that they look very different.</p><p dir="ltr">
	The image most of us have of the South African TRC is of black and white people embracing each other in the spirit of forgiveness and the world-historical glow of the end of apartheid. Leaving aside the <a href="http://www.scielo.org.za/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0259-01902008000100009" target="_blank">dubious accuracy</a> of this image, in South Africa, the TRC followed the end of a racist system of dispossession and oppression. In Canada, Indigenous people had to sue to the government to get a truth commission, and they're paying for it themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">
	The South African TRC also had both the powers of subpoena and immunity. The commission could compel, for example, former apartheid police officers who had summarily executed black political leaders to tell their families where the bodies were buried, without the threat of criminal charges. In Canada, <a href="http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/index.php?p=10" target="_blank">the TRC has neither.</a> That means that while in theory, the TRC gives space for victims and perpetrators to meet, it hasn't really looked like that.</p><p dir="ltr">
	In some ways, our truth commission is like any other truth commission: it has spent much of its time recording endlessly gut-wrenching testimony about the experience of living under a structurally racist institution. But mostly it has been aboriginal people speaking. Survivors, children of survivors, family members. There were periodic "Expressions of Reconciliation," statements from provincial and municipal levels of government, as well as from representatives of churches.</p><p dir="ltr">
	For its part, the federal government has been conspicuously and ironically absent. Its formal presence at the national event was limited to an information table, which seemed to be primarily giving away little Canadian flag pins and stickers. There were also copies of the government's <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2012/06/11/four_years_later_harpers_apology_for_residential_schools_rings_hollow_for_many.html">widely criticized</a> official <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prime-minister-stephen-harper-s-statement-of-apology-1.734250">apology</a> to residential school survivors. These were printed in cursive typeface on aged-looking paper and rolled up, like treaties.</p><p dir="ltr">
	On February 18 of this year, a group of former residential school students <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/in-photos-st-michaels-residential-school-demolition-ceremony/article23067843/?from=23067233" target="_blank">gathered at the crumbling steps</a> of St. Mike's in Yalis, on the unceded territory of the 'Namgis First Nation. They held a healing ceremony employing the very language, culture, and spirituality that staff and government administrators labored for decades to erase from their minds. They sang and danced, sharing stories and crying.</p><p dir="ltr">
	Chief Robert Joseph of the Gwawaenuk First Nation <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/aadncanada/16731932098/in/photolist-ruxwtU-rM3c7M-ruyJ6S-qQkB6g-rM3bZH-rM1QYJ-9XpAoS-9XmHX4-9XpA39-9XpzUL-rJPvQG-5gCEqy-pJM6s-pJM6C-ruyHAy-qQkB3R-ruxvYL-qQkAzB-5gGtiT-q32UX-pJM6v-gub4Cu-omDSt7-qmqQ9E-r2121R-qmEWEM-r1UDLC-r1U35s-qZ6vGP-rirKC4-riqJdc-qmrCFN-r1VKpj-r1UEWm-rinQC9-r22K9g-qms4V5-r1SAB3-rijnCc-qmDbG8-r221aR-qmE9Qa-rik1RR-qmsr3f-r1TRbo-ripdZ1-rijgHB-r1Zdze-riqibZ-qmG4Pz" target="_blank">described</a> how he arrived at St. Mike's as a six-year-old, carrying only a small suitcase. He wouldn't return to his isolated Kingcome Inlet community until he was 19. After <a href="http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/comment/story.html?id=5a971f9d-0989-40c6-97a6-0f25145687d0" target="_blank">years of sexual, spiritual, and physical abuse</a>, he returned, in his words, "a broken person."</p><p dir="ltr">
	The former Executive Director of the Indian Residential School Survivors Society and head of <a href="http://reconciliationcanada.ca/welcome/who-we-are/" target="_blank">Reconciliation Canada</a> explained why the event was named l'tustolagalis. "It means 'Rising Up, Together' in Kwak'wala," he explained. "It's a testament to our culture, to our resilience."</p><p dir="ltr">
	"The other reality is, of course," he added, "that we have many people who have come to join us in this country, and they are never going away. Somehow we need to find a way to coexist."</p><p dir="ltr">
	At the end of the ceremony, survivors and their families stood together and hurled rock after rock at the building's still-imposing brick walls, until a backhoe came to begin the demolition in earnest. It would be days before St. Mike's, one of the last residential schools still standing, was finally reduced to rubble.</p><p dir="ltr">
	Up on the hill, the Big House looked on.</p><p dir="ltr">

<title>VICE Premiere: VICE Exclusive: Check Out Unsung 80s Post-Punk Heroes the Mothmen</title>

<description><![CDATA[<iframe width="100%" height="450" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/110904479&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;visual=true"></iframe><p>
	The Mothmen were a short-lived English post-punk band who, despite their quick lifespan, managed to churn out a small but strong batch of visionary music that was way ahead of its time. Their second album, <em>Pay Attention!</em>, released by dub label On-U Sound in 1981, is an angular, jittery pop record, with just enough weirdness to wander into the realm of psychedelia. It saw limited release and, for the most part, the band was forgotten to time. Now, On-U Sound is reissuing<em> Pay Attention!</em> complete with some unreleased bonus tracks, and the band is finally getting the recognition they deserve. Everybody from Liars to Battles to Deerhoof and the Dirty Projectors owe a great debt to the Mothmen's interlocking riffs and rhythms, whether they know it or not. I chatted with two of the band's original members—drummer Chris Joyce and multi-instrumentalist Bob Harding—about their band, why post-punk is stupid, and On-U's reissue, which will be out June 2.</p><p><strong>VICE: How did the rediscovery of this album change your perspectives on the music you guys made together?<br></strong><strong>Chris Joyce: </strong>I was always very proud of what the Mothmen did. The music was crazy and self-indulgent, but that was because we were young and didn't give a fuck. We weren't doing it for any sort of commercial success or to be trendy. It came about because of wanting to experiment with the perceived norm.</p><p dir="ltr">
	<strong>Bob Harding:</strong> A couple of nights ago I listened to the entire album (including the bonus tracks) and I really enjoyed it. Prior to the current reissue project I hadn't thought much about the album in years. With the reissue in the pipeline, a lot of people—especially some a lot younger than me—started saying how much they liked the album. I'd still say it was a bit self-indulgent but I think it had a lot of balls and attitude too... Not to mention a touch of humor as well.</p><p>
	<strong>You've all since worked on numerous other projects. How has your creative attitude evolved since you wrote these songs?<br></strong>The other projects I've worked on have been in management and running a record label which certainly require a bit of creativity but it's not the same as the artistic kind. The Blood and Fire label could certainly have been a bit more of a creative experience for me but that's not the way it panned out and I ended up being the book-keeper basically. Does creative accountancy count?
</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Joyce: </strong>It wasn't long after <em>Pay Attention!</em> was recorded that we, as individuals, needed to earn money either because kids were on the way or rent had to be paid. One is still the same person who did the crazy stuff but also had the skills to do the "straighter" money-earning music. The creative attitude comes from the same well of musical knowledge, it just gets applied in a different way.
</p><p>
	<strong>Will you try to do any touring or live material?</strong><br><strong>Harding:</strong> Personally speaking, the answer is a definite "No." I know there are people of my age and even older who are still touring but it doesn't really appeal to me. On a personnel level it would be extremely difficult anyway; out of the four original members one is dead and the whereabouts of another currently unknown. That just leaves Chris and me.  Our best bet would probably be to train up a bunch of young kids and send them out as the Mothmen to play <em>Pay Attention!</em> live.</p><p dir="ltr">
	<strong>How do you feel about the "post-punk" label being retroactively assigned to your music?<br></strong>Post-punk is one of those catch-all labels which doesn't describe any particular genre but merely references a particular moment in time. In musical terms, "post-punk" could be a lot of things but I think the one strand that pulls them all together would be that punk's DIY ethos continued to be embraced in the post-punk era.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	The most obvious manifestation of this was the emergence of hundreds of small independent labels. Some thrived, some fell by the wayside, some like On-U Sound are still going strong. Many new genres have emerged and the digital revolution has totally transformed the landscape but I would say that the continued existence of a vibrant indie scene would be the legacy of the post-punk era.
</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Joyce: </strong>Post-punk seems to be of more importance to people who like labels and journalists who need to have a hat to hang an article on. And also people who weren't there at the time. As far as what can be learned from it... Go and listen to the music, do your own research, educate yourself!
</p><p>
	<strong>Thanks guys. Glad your album is finally getting the recognition it deserves.</strong></p>

</p><p>
	<i>This article appears in the <a href="http://www.vice.com/magazine/22/5" target="_blank">May Issue of VICE Magazine. </a></i></p><p><i>Excerpted from </i>The Making of Zombie Wars: A Novel <i>by Aleksandar Hemon. Copyright 2015 by Aleksandar Hemon. Excerpted with permission of Farrar, Straus and Giroux.</i>
</p><p>
	Script Idea #2: <i>An elderly contract killer with a heart condition is forced to go into retirement after he failed at his last hit. It's his only miss, so when he has a chance to redo it and restore his perfect record, he cannot say no, even if he's risking a heart attack. But then he falls in love with the target's teenage daughter. Title: </i>The Last Heart
</p><p>
	Script Idea #7: <i>A blind man and a blind woman, attracted to each other by smell. On their ﬁrst date, they ﬁnd themselves at a murder scene and catch the killer's particular scent. Nobody believes them, and the perfumed killer is now pursuing them. Title:</i> Where Do We Go from Nowhere
</p><p>
	Script Idea #12:<i> DJ Spinoza is a misﬁt no one understands: not his schoolmates, not his friends, not his teachers. His one dream is to DJ at his prom night and blow all those assholes away. After his radical DJ-ing results in a disastrous party at the place of the girl (Rise) he aims to hook up with, he ends up castigated. What will it take to make everyone dance and Rise fall for him? Title:</i> Spinning Out of Control
</p><p>
	Now, what could I do with the boy? Joshua asked himself. All human feelings are derived from pleasure, pain, and desire—but most importantly, Spin could say to Rise, from the beat. And what if he said nothing? What if he was the strong, silent type? Why this and not that? Writing is nothing if not carrying the hopeless, backbreaking burden of decisions devoid of consequences.<br>
</p><p>
	Afternoon at the Coffee Shoppe slipped into evening just as Joshua's caffeination reached the heights of the Rwandan plantations where his beverage originated. Hence he was burning to surf the web for Rwanda, learn some interesting facts about other cultures, and allow his current creative dilemmas to resolve themselves. Back in the day, before the worldwide web of temptation, there used to be that thing called inspiration. Then the spirit was perpetually displaced by trivia and vanity search. Mercifully, there was no internet access at the Coffee Shoppe.<br>
</p><!--recommended--><p>
	Hence Joshua opened up a ﬁle with another script in perpetual development (title: <i>The Snakeman Blues</i>), in which a comic-book geek and a retired superhero (the Snakeman), ungainfully employed as a public-school English teacher, team up to ﬁght the evil mayor of Chicago. Joshua was incapable of deciding whether the Snakeman would die at the end or live to go back to teaching—the truly heroic activity in the city of Chicago—and if so, whether he would do so in his human or his serpentine form. The happy ending was corny, while the death was depressing, and Joshua could think of nothing in between. Besides, how exactly would a reptile ﬁght the CPD and the devious mayor?<br>
</p><p>
	Too hypoglycemic to type a word, which would then perhaps lead to the next word, he could only perceive the blank space below what he'd written last. (Snakeman: Don't! Let's take care of the boss ﬁrst.) Baruch the Spinner was right: Inﬁnity exhausts all reality. But ﬁnitude does it too, almost. Joshua stared at the crosswalk outside the Coffee Shoppe where nothing was happening, until he discovered some comfort in devising wisecracks for some imaginary audience at some future dinner party: How is a <i>shoppe</i> different from a shop? Did the Wife of Bath drink soy-milk chai lattes? Are the Middle English–speaking baristas commonly stricken with the Black Death, etc.?<br>
</p><p>
	He was about to open a new ﬁle to log all the shoppe cracks, when a pack of ROTC cadets appeared on the Olive Street horizon in fatefully slow motion, reminding him of that long shot in <i>Lawrence of Arabia </i>where in the ﬂat-line desert a speck grows into a horseman. The cadets forded the street fake-punching one another, slapping their shaven necks, no worry in their lives, save the fear of being expelled from the pack. And then he saw them in the desert, thickly coated in dust, tongue-hanging thirsty on their way to a battle where they would mature and/or heroically die, the nefarious natives offering them contaminated piss-warm water in beaten tin cups. The cadets couldn't begin to conceive of their sandstorming future; they couldn't as much as pity themselves in advance. In fact, they could see little beyond their imminent meal, beyond acting out their childish toughness, beyond playacting hand-to-hand combat at lunch break. He who has a mind capable of a great many things has a body whose greatest part is eternal, wrote Baruch. And out of the sad ROTC mindlessness the scene from <i>Dawn of the Dead </i>was recollected in which zombies tottered in circles around a depopulated shopping mall unable to forget their life before their undeath, their infected brains still retaining the remnants of their happy Christmas memories. A chubby cadet sensed the intensity of Joshua's inspired gaze and, as the rest of the corps trundled on to the next-door sandwich shop, stopped to grin at him from the other side of the window. His face was wide, his cheeks ﬂushed, his front teeth of uneven sizes like a skyline, his eyes lit up with the arrogant innocence of youth. In a blissful blink, Joshua saw the narrative landscape neatly laid down before him: all the endless possibilities, all the overhead and wide shots, all the graceful character trajectories blazing across the spectacular ﬁrmament, all the expanse conducive to a love interest—all Joshua had to do was stroll through that Edenic symmetry and write it down. This time, he was determined, his vision would not decompose in the computer memory with the skeletons of his other ideas: He opened, right then and there, a new Final Draft ﬁle and created the title page to stare at it:
</p><p align="center">
	<i>Zombie Wars</i><br>
	by  Joshua  Levin 
	<br>
	Chicago, March 31, 2003
</p><p>
	Whereupon he stared at it.<br>
</p><p>
	Alas, unless you're the Lord himself, creation cannot be willed: Joshua needed to eat something before embarking upon it, and hence stood in line behind an overtattooed prick who couldn't decide between banana and pumpkin bread, while the barista in a Che Guevara hat (yet presumably ﬂuent in Middle fucking English) looked on indifferently. The impasse allowed Joshua to imagine a zombie biting into the prick's neck tattoos, blood splashing the ready lattes, turning them pink, the zombie oblivious to the hysterically hissing espresso machine. The revolutionary Chaucerian barista, artistically striving for the perfect foam, took an eternity to steam the milk for Joshua's cappuccino, giving enough time for the zombie apocalypse to smoothly exhaust its cataclysmic reality and sink to the bottom of Joshua's mind. Back at his shaky table, he sat munching on carrot bread until he reached a Zen-worthy level of caffeine-crash blankness. He closed the ﬁle, then the program, and then, ﬁnally, his computer, to put it in his bag, to sleep.

</p><p>
	Substantial portions of Joshua's life had been wasted before, leaving no trace of trauma or regret. But the pressing problem on this particular Monday was that he needed to turn in some pages to his Screenwriting II workshop(pe?), which was to be conducted that night at Graham's place for the ﬁrst time. The Birkenstock cocksuckers from the Film Collective were bloodsuckers as well, per Graham, taking a shameless cut of the class fee without bothering to provide enough toilet paper. He'd been paying for it out of his pocket, until he'd concluded that his faithful workshoppers could just as well wipe their asses at his humble abode, while he could keep all the money for himself.<br>
</p><p>
	The pageless Joshua, equipped only with the vaguest zombie memories, was thus ensconced in a purple beanbag on Graham's living-room ﬂoor. Pretzels and a spacious plastic bottle of deﬁzzed Diet Coke crowded the coffee table. With his testicles squeezed by his twisted underwear, Joshua avoided all eye contact with the beﬂanneled Dillon, outlining some idea of his, hip-deep in the faded, sunken futon. Bega was there too, hunched at the desk in a Motörhead T-shirt, contemplating the splendorously lit Wrigley Field in Graham's window. The baseball crowd emitted a home-run roar and Bega grunted wistfully, his thick, unneatly parted gray hair conspicuously rhyming with the grayish shrub on his face. Graham interrupted Dillon's rambling to make a point by sharing a pertinent section from the script he'd just completed.<br>
</p><p>
	"Blessed be the amateurs!" Graham spoke in the bloated voice of one of his cardboard characters. "The triers, the failers, the shit-swimmers! Let us praise those who dream big and achieve nothing, those undaunted by impossibilities, entrapped by possibilities! They are the dung beetles of the American dream, the unsung little fertilizers of American soil."<br>
</p><p>
	Graham rubbed his thumb pensively against his cleft chin as he looked up at his audience for their reaction: Dillon was looming over an open notebook in his lap, writing something down furiously; Bega nodded, chewing his Bic pen to pieces; Joshua was ﬁxated on Graham, but only because his very balls were swelling in the painful squeeze. Addressing the problem required standing up and shoving his hand into his pants to free his testicles from the grip of his underwear. He was not ready for such a commitment, so he endured. The mind can imagine nothing except while the body endures.<br>
</p><p>
	"Just so you don't wonder what happens," Graham continued, "my boy goes on to make it big. He's gonna bottom out at the end of Act Two, but then comes back in Act Three, winning a Golden Globe."<br>
</p><p>
	Joshua tried to reach for his backpack, but the pain in his groin made him gasp and sit back. Graham's living room was overwhelmed with paperbacks—on the shelves, on the ﬂoor, on the windowsills—all of them dusty and invested in the magic of ﬁlm and the science of screenwriting. The only wall without the books featured a gigantic poster for <i>The Godfather: Part II</i>, Al Pacino looming over them like Jesus in an altarpiece.<br>
</p><p>
	"This is all based on a true story, gentlemen. Hollywood big shots lined up all the way to the Hills to have a diet soda with me, but I wasn't gonna let them fuck me! No, sir!" Graham ﬂashed his middle ﬁnger to the erstwhile line of big shots. "Feel free to fuck yourselves, you bunch of Weinsteins!"<br>
</p><p>
	Graham rocked back and forth, Hasidim-like, as he ranted, his bald crown reddening patchily like a lava lamp. Bega seemed to enjoy the rant, as he abandoned the Bic mastication for a hearty laugh. Meanwhile, Joshua rolled out of the beanbag to stand up, grimacing in the pain overriding Graham's anti-Semitic insinuations.<br>
</p><p>
	"Point is," Graham continued, "you're willing to learn, and that's undoubtedly fucking great. So, Dillon, to be perfectly and productively honest, that's far from the smartest idea I've ever heard. But we're gonna work on it all day long and we're gonna make it good."<br>
</p><p>
	Dillon wrote something down, then turned the page to write some more. Joshua ﬁnally pulled down his pants to release his balls, in the process of which his navel-eye blinked at everyone from a tuft of hair.<br>
</p><p>
	"What in hell are you doing?" Graham asked.<br>
</p><p>
	"Inadvertent self-wedgie," Joshua explained.<br>
</p><p>
	Graham slapped his hands, startling Dillon. "Do you hear that, Dillon? Inadvertent self-wedgie! Write that down! That's what you want your characters to say, not some anodyne bullshit about corporate greed."<br>
</p><p>
	The pleasure of unclasping his balls was compounded by Graham's praise, so Joshua felt entitled to make Dillon scoot over and sat down on the futon. He examined the night outside: the sparkle of the ball game all over Wrigleyville; the lit L train struggling along the Sheridan curve; the Lake Shore skyscrapers on the horizon; the endless darkness beyond. Bega shook his hair over the desk, as if trying to get something out of it. Could it be lice?<br>
</p><p>
	Joshua had been in Screenwriting I with Bega; they'd never talked much beyond exchanging remarks on their inchoate scripts. Bega would always project mean superiority while mocking the inane plots in the pages of other workshoppers. His plots would not be much better, but he'd protect himself by withholding their resolutions, claiming he wanted to keep them all involved.<br>
</p><p>
	"Is there such a thing as an advertent self-wedgie?" Dillon asked.<br>
</p><p>
	"There are all kinds of wedgies. Let a thousand ﬂowers bloom," Graham said. "What happens next?"<br>
</p><p>
	Dillon consulted his notebook. There was no writing in its pages, Joshua noticed, only doodled arabesques.<br>
</p><p>
	"They're like in the desert," Dillon said, "and there are like all these things. He like stops by the fear booth and these like guys ask him what his fears are and he says, it's like sharks and waves, and these like guys come out dressed as his worst fears and like follow him around. And then he takes shrooms with the goth girl, and they go on the most fantastic trip of their like life, and then he decides not to go on to LA for the job and like live with the goth girl in the desert community."<br>
</p><p>
	Graham watched him intently, conceptualizing the fear booth and the guys dressed as sharks and waves. "That's gonna cost a lot of money," he said.<br>
</p><p>
	Evidently, money had never crossed Dillon's mind—he wrote money in an empty space left between the arabesques, then underlined it twice.<br>
</p><p>
	"Fact: you need no money to write a script, but you need oodles to make a movie. Fact: you will have to beg for money, part of the job." Graham began rocking again. "And the Weinsteins will unleash their twenty-two-year-old dipshit suckerﬁsh to skim your life's work in one lazy afternoon. Then they'll throw at you the piddly coin they spend monthly on their chest depilation and expect you to work with that. You need to know you're nothing to them! You're a zero! Absolute fucking nothing! Zero!"<br>
</p><p class="has-image">
	<img src="http://scs-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/int/v22n5/htdocs/inception-of-zombie-wars/fearbooth.jpg" alt="" border="0" height="1554" width="1200">
</p><p>
	Bega laughed again—Graham's hatred of the Weinsteins seemed to amuse him to no end. Joshua's chest constricted with a gasp of guilt—he should counter the slight but couldn't. Dillon blinked in what must have been panic at the blotches ﬂoating across the expanses of Graham's cranium. He then returned to the safety of doodling: At phenomenal speed he was now turning spirals into tornadoes, which in the upper half of the page biblically connected with darkness. On the opposite, tornado-free page, there was a scene featuring stick people with speech bubbles over their O-heads, one of them grasping an oval surfboard with his stick hand. <i>Zombie Wars</i>, Joshua thought. Where do we go from nowhere?<br>
</p><p>
	"The good news is that if you could get a hunky male star to be the surfer dude you might be able to ﬁnd some dough," Graham said, having steadied himself. "Maybe that, what's his name, Hartnett?"<br>
</p><p>
	"I think you should make this dude more of real person," Bega said. It was surprising to hear him talk—he'd been laughing on the fringes all night. "He should be normal, little bit of philosopher, maybe loser. Like Josh here."<br>
</p><p>
	In Screenwriting I, Bega had wittily and deservedly, Joshua thought, picked on a Peruvian whose drafts had featured Inca gods ﬁghting sea monsters. This time Joshua said: "Me? How did I come into this?"<br>
</p><p>
	From a distance, they all examined Joshua, the survivor of an inadvertent self-wedgie: the body of a lightweight wrestler who'd quit wrestling after middle school; the droopy eyes that, in a more ﬂattering light, could appear contemplatively sorrowful; the slight overbite that often made him look unduly perplexed.<br>
</p><p>
	"To be perfectly honest, ﬁnding hunkiness in Joshua is a challenge," Graham said. "I'm just kidding."<br>
</p><p>
	Dillon laughed, relieved that Graham was off his back, and embarked upon drawing houses with smoke-spewing chimneys. Crematoria? Was it a subliminal—or, fuck it, liminal—way for Dillon to align himself with Graham's latent anti-Semitism? Even before the crematoria tableau, Joshua ﬁrmly believed that Dillon's chubbiness was born of devotion to obscure 90s bands, which required a uniform: ﬂannel shirt, Costello glasses, expensive trucker hat. And who comes from LA to take screenwriting workshops in Chicago? He probably came here to <i>like live</i> for free with his grandmother, Mrs. Alzheimer, née Loaded.<br>
</p><p>
	"Now that he brought your ass up, Josh," Graham says, "whaddya got? Fresh, stunning work? A roller-coaster ride of violence and sex?"<br>
</p><p>
	Bega leaned forward to hear Joshua, his eyebrows' grays now shimmering under the desk light.<br>
</p><p>
	"I don't think I have pages. But I do think I have a new idea," Joshua said. "The working title is <i>Zombie Wars</i>."<br>
</p><p>
	"What happened to DJ Spinoza?" Graham asked.<br>
</p><p>
	"I need to ﬁgure some things out. I can't hear the music yet."<br>
</p><p>
	"And what about your teacher superhero?"<br>
</p><p>
	"He can wait his turn," Joshua said. "The world is full of superheroes."<br>
</p><p>
	"Sure it is," Graham said, "as it's just about to run out of zombies."<br>
</p><p>
	Dillon snickered. Joshua imagined smacking him with the back of his hand. That boy could be a tasty snack for a zombie. Bega nodded, as though approving of Joshua's vision.<br>
</p><p>
	"OK," Graham said, with exaggerated patience, "let's pretend you don't change your mind every week. Let's pretend we don't give a ﬂying fuck. OK. What matters is how good in the room you are. So: pitch me the damn thing! I'm your fat Weinstein. Make me fall in love with you and your story! Sell me <i>Zombie Wars</i>! I got what you need! I got no brains, but I got oodles of money!"<br>
</p><p>
	Joshua inhaled. He imagined a fat Weinstein behind an intimidating desk, glowering at him; he also considered getting up and leaving, never to see Graham or endure his knee-jerk bigotry, never to write another line of dialogue. There was a solid case to be made for a screenwriting career entirely organized around avoiding the Weinsteins as well as for a life arranged around the absence of hope and ambition. But Bega was looking at Joshua as though burning to hear what he had to say, and Joshua exhaled. Anything whatever can be the accidental cause of hope or fear.<br>
</p><p>
	"OK. OK: The American government has a secret program to turn immigrants into slaves," he improvised. "The government creates a virus to turn them into zombies who work in factories, chained to the production line."<br>
</p><p>
	Now they all watched him with apparent interest. Dillon stopped doodling; the blotches on Graham's forehead merged into a solid vermilion ﬁeld; Bega nodded at Joshua again, approving of the immigrant aspect. It was difﬁcult to make stuff up in the limelight of their attention, but he'd leapt up and now had no choice but to fall.<br>
</p><p>
	"Things go wrong," Joshua said. "Things go terribly wrong."<br>
</p><p>
	"They would," Graham said.<br>
</p><p>
	"And virus spreads?" Bega asked. "Not just immigrants are infected?"<br>
</p><p>
	"Yeah," Joshua said. "The virus deﬁnitely spreads. Anybody can get infected."<br>
</p><p>
	"Who's gonna stay alive?" Graham asked. "Any ladies?"   <br>
</p><p>
	"Not sure," Joshua said. "Probably. Some will pop up as I work on it."<br>
</p><p>
	"The virus spreads, then what?" Dillon asked. He'd stopped doodling.<br>
</p><p>
	"Well," Joshua said, slowly, to bide his time. "Well, the government sends out the military. To wipe them all out. The army guys just shoot them in the head and blow them up and have fun. It would be a bloodbath, if zombies actually bled. But there are so many undead immigrants that soldiers turn into zombies too, and they start killing everybody, not just foreigners. Things get crazy, killers and zombies everywhere, chaos, no one to trust, nowhere to go. It's a nightmare."<br>

</p><p>
	It all just came out, without effort or thinking. It felt like lying, only better, because he couldn't be caught, and he couldn't be caught because there was nothing to verify it against. Immersed in the ﬂow of bullshit, they had no reason, or time, not to believe him.<br>
</p><p>
	"But there is an army doctor, Major Klopstock, who believes he can beat the virus. Major Klopstock works on a vaccine..."<br>
</p><p>
	"Wait a minute," Graham said. "What kind of a name is that? Major Klopstock? Are you kidding me? Might as well call him Major Crapshit."<br>
</p><p>
	"I actually like Klopstock," Joshua said. "Klopstock could be a main hero, why not?"<br>
</p><p>
	"Do you really think Bruce Willis would agree to be named Klopstock? You could never pay him enough for that. Think of something else."<br>
</p><p>
	This was a chance for Joshua to confront Graham and defend Major Klopstock's implied Jewishness. On the other hand, the character was not quite alive yet, nor was Joshua married to the name; and strictly speaking, Graham hadn't actually mentioned his Jewishness. This was neither the time nor the place.<br>
</p><p>
	"OK: Major Something Else gives the vaccine to himself," Joshua went on. "At ﬁrst we don't know if he'll make it, or become a kind of zombie himself."<br>
</p><p>
	"And then what?" Dillon said.<br>
</p><p>
	"And then struggle ensues," Joshua said. "That's what the story is about. The major's struggle."<br>
</p><p>
	"Struggle is good. Outside the name problem, it's a start," Graham said. "Maybe the army can also ﬁght some, like, terrorist zombies, blowing themselves up like crazy. It's a good time to be thinking about all that, given that we're just about to tear a new hole in the ass of Iraq."<br>
</p><p>
	"I didn't actually think of that," Joshua said.<br>
</p><p>
	"It could be fun, believe me. We unleash the zombie army at the camelfuckers and then it all ﬂies off the handle and our undead boys come back to feed on our ﬂesh. I think that's pretty fucking good. Don't you think it's good? Let me pat myself on the back!"<br>
</p><p>
	Graham patted himself on the back.<br>
</p><p>
	"I don't know," Joshua said. "I don't want it to be too political."<br>
</p><p>
	"Why not?" Bega offered. "Look at situation now. Muslim enemies everywhere, every movie, everything on television, everybody happy to invade. Everything is political. Everybody is political."<br>
</p><p>
	"Hey, they took our towers down," Graham said. "Revenge is a dish best served with carpet bombing."<br>
</p><p>
	"Saddam had nothing to do with towers," Bega said. "No connection."<br>
</p><p>
	"People say we did it ourselves," Dillon said, "so that we could like attack Iraq and take their like oil."<br>
</p><p>
	The red patch ﬂared up on Graham's forehead, but then he chose to say nothing and the blotch disintegrated.<br>
</p><p>
	"I'd love to bullshit for a living, my friends," he said instead, "but right now you're paying me oodles to help you with your screenwriting. You got ten minutes, Vega, if you want to talk about your stuff."<br>
</p><p>
	"I'm just saying," Dillon said.<br>
</p><p>
	"Bega," Bega said. "I am Bega. As I was before." "Whatever. <i>Vega. Bega.</i> You can call yourself Klopstock for all I care. Let a thousand ﬂowers bloom," Graham said. "Whaddya got? Pages?"<br>
</p><p>
	"No pages. Pages I have when I know everything."<br>
</p><p>
	Bega rubbed his face vigorously with both hands and then scratched his skull, rufﬂing his hair, possibly releasing some lice. He grinned as if experiencing a spasm. Something was always happening on his face, some ﬂow of tricky mental states ever visible.<br>
</p><p>
	"It's basically love story," Bega said. "Man is from Sarajevo. He was happy there. He was young, he had rock group, had women. War came. He is refugee now. He goes to Germany. They are Nazis there. He works like security in disco, plays his guitar only for his soul. He drinks, remembers Sarajevo, writes blues songs. Comes 1997, Nazis  throw him out. He goes back to Sarajevo, but nothing is same. Heartbreak."<br>
</p><p>
	"Yeah, yeah... We heard that the last time. Got something beyond that?"<br>
</p><p>
	"Can I smoke?" Bega asked.<br>
</p><p>
	"Can you <i>smoke</i>? Can you smoke? Hell no!" Graham said. "With all due respect."<br>
</p><p>
	"OK," Bega said, licking his lips. "Man has no more friends in Sarajevo. Half of his group is dead, other half everywhere. Women have husbands. Everybody talks about the war all the time. He says, Fuck it! and goes to America— country of Dylan and Nirvana and best basketball. But he lost his soul. And American women are all feminists—"<br>
</p><p>
	"Ain't that the truth," Graham said.<br>
</p><p>
	"—and he works in store that sells guitars. One day mother and daughter come in. Mother is pretty but daughter is fantastic. He plays a beautiful song for them from Sarajevo. Daughter falls in love with him. It is like in love novels, but mother calls police. He is stalker, she says, because she's jealous."<br>
</p><p>
	"How old is the daughter?" Dillon asked.<br>
</p><p>
	Bega failed to hear him. At some point his gaze drifted toward the <i>Godfather: Part II</i> poster and he spoke as if pitching his story to Saint Pacino himself.<br>
</p><p>
	"But then mother dies from pills for depression. Daughter thinks he killed her. Police thinks it's him too. Newspapers think it's him. He has to prove it's not him. He's just immigrant, but his picture is everywhere. All America hates him. Big problem."<br>
</p><p>
	"Is there a killer?" Joshua asked, returning the favor of attention.<br>
</p><p>
	"Maybe husband," Bega said. "Maybe not."<br>
</p><p>
	"That's pretty good," Graham said. "Immigrant detective, that's pretty cool. Like you are illegal, but you have to go around to ﬁgure things out. I would be careful about the detective clichés, though. And also grammar."<br>
</p><p>
	"Maybe the daughter can help clear his name," Joshua said. "I'm a little concerned about the ending."<br>
</p><p>
	"American movies always have happy ending," Bega said. "Life is tragedy: You're born, you live, you die."<br>
</p><p>
	"This could be like a European art-house movie. Which would be good because you could show tits," Graham said, pausing to picture the tits. "Anyway, we gotta go. Next time, I'd like to see some pages. Things change when you have pages. It all becomes real."<br>
</p><p>
	"Real is real good," Dillon said.

	The final years of the 
	<a href="https://www.vice.com/tag/vietnam%20war" target="_blank">Vietnam War</a> were filled with chaos and disappointment. The conflict between the US and Vietcong wouldn't officially end until the infamous fall of Saigon in 1975, but in the spring of 1971 the Nixon administration began pulling troops out of the area, starting a long and messy end to one of America's most unpopular wars.
</p><!--recommended--><p dir="ltr">
	Through those years, many US soldiers were cycled in and out of the conflict. Some came home in one piece, others in body bags. But there was one group of US veterans who, despite serving bravely and saving countless lives, were either <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/LIVING/02/12/war.dogs/" target="_blank">executed or abandoned by the military</a> they served, says former US soldier Rick Claggett. These were the Military Working Dogs of the Vietnam War, who Claggett describes as being considered "surplus equipment" at the war's end. Despite pleas from dog handlers who wanted to take their fellow soldiers home with them, the US military decided <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/05/140519-dogs-war-canines-soldiers-troops-military-vietnam/" target="_blank">to abandon</a>—and likely euthanize—many of the dogs, leaving the rest to the South Vietnamese.<b></b></p><p class="has-image">
	[body_image width='750' height='444' path='images/content-images/2015/05/06/' crop='images/content-images-crops/2015/05/06/' filename='the-us-military-euthanized-or-abandoned-3000-of-their-own-canine-soldiers-at-the-end-of-the-vietnam-war-253-body-image-1430931205.png' id='53398']
</p><p dir="ltr">
	Like many young men of his time, Claggett was drafted into the Army in 1970. Being more of a cat person, the only reason he enlisted in a program for dog handlers was for the extra six months of training in the States—he thought that might be long enough to wait out the war's end. But when he was inevitably shipped out, Claggett ended up forming a close relationship with his scout dog, Big Boy, who he says he still thinks about to this day, nearly 44 years later.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	Claggett went on to work for the Environmental Protection Agency for 33 years, and is now retired, living in Denver, Colorado. He joined the Vietnam Dog Handlers Association, giving lectures to various groups on his experiences as a dog handler during the war. Claggett spoke to VICE about what it was like to form a personal relationship with his dog, how Big Boy helped him cope with the stress of war, and why he will never forget having to leave him behind.
</p><p class="has-image">
	[body_image width='750' height='485' path='images/content-images/2015/05/06/' crop='images/content-images-crops/2015/05/06/' filename='the-us-military-euthanized-or-abandoned-3000-of-their-own-canine-soldiers-at-the-end-of-the-vietnam-war-253-body-image-1430931226.png' id='53399']

	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	VICE: What role did the dogs play in Vietnam, and which breeds were used for which jobs?<br>
	</strong><strong>Rick </strong><strong>Claggett:</strong> Labrador retrievers were used for only one job: Following blood trails. So if contact was made with the enemy and they were wounded, then they call in a Lab team—which was the dog and the handler. They used Labs because they're silent trackers. You don't want a Bloodhound or a Beagle, which have an equally strong nose, but make a lot of noise when it's on track. We also trained Labs to alert us of a human ambush or a mechanical ambush.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	German Shepherds did everything else, like mine and tunnel. If there was a small Shepherd, they might try to train him to go down into a tunnel. If he was an aggressive dog, he might be put as a sentry dog.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	Then there were water patrol dogs. They would put a dog in front of a small boat, and move around the area, because the dog could pick up the scent of somebody swimming underneath the water and breathing through a hollow reed, which humans couldn't detect. There were drug enforcement dogs. And scout dogs, which was what I had in Vietnam. A scout dog's job is to lead a patrol on the field. They're the ones trained to smell out human ambushes and mechanical ambushes.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	[As a Scout dog handler] you're the first person in the patrol, and you're pretty vulnerable. Behind snipers and helicopter pilots, dog handlers had the third highest mortality rate.
</p><p class="has-image">
	[body_image width='750' height='649' path='images/content-images/2015/05/06/' crop='images/content-images-crops/2015/05/06/' filename='the-us-military-euthanized-or-abandoned-3000-of-their-own-canine-soldiers-at-the-end-of-the-vietnam-war-253-body-image-1430931248.png' id='53400']
</p><p dir="ltr">
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	If the handlers had such high mortality rates in the field, how effective were these dogs at sniffing out ambushes?<br>
	</strong>They might alert you to a human ambush, but you're out in the open and the enemy knows that they've been detected, so they open up and kill the dogs and the handlers. Four hundred handlers were killed in Vietnam.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	I've heard people say that there would be 10,000 more names on that wall in Washington DC if there were no dog soldiers in Vietnam. That's somebody's estimate about how many lives they saved. As far as the dogs' mortality, there were about <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_6003386" target="_blank">4,000 dogs that served in Vietnam</a> over the course of the war, and about a thousand of those dogs were killed, either from direct gunfire, booby-traps, heat-stroke, snake-bite, disease, accidents, old age... a myriad of causes.<em> [<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Editor's note: </strong>As these dogs' deaths went largely undocumented, VICE was unable to corroborate exact numbers with the US Military, though one technical sergeant stated that the facts "sounded correct."]</em></p><p dir="ltr" class="has-image">
	[body_image width='750' height='403' path='images/content-images/2015/05/06/' crop='images/content-images-crops/2015/05/06/' filename='the-us-military-euthanized-or-abandoned-3000-of-their-own-canine-soldiers-at-the-end-of-the-vietnam-war-253-body-image-1430931442.png' id='53406']
</p><p dir="ltr">
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Were the dogs viewed as just another tool, like a gun or a radio? I imagine you would have to bond with the dog to some degree to have a working relationship.<br>
	</strong>You have to bond with the dog tremendously. My dog was named Big Boy, and he'd been there for four years. He'd been through several handlers already, so he knew what he was doing. I was the green one. I spent about two weeks with him just bonding, just building up a relationship, so he wants to work with you and you want to work with him.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	They weren't a piece of equipment to us. I think I can speak for around 95 percent of the dog handlers that I have talked with since the war, and everybody said, "I loved that dog." It wasn't a piece of equipment like a gun or something like that. It was a living, breathing thing that had emotions and played and did all kinds of dog things. You just fall in love with that dog, and that certainly was the case with my dog, Big Boy.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	I was fortunate that not only was he experienced, but he was very friendly. Some guys had aggressive dogs and couldn't take them around like I could. I would take Big Boy with me almost every place I went. And I didn't even have to have him tied up [on a leash], because he would just follow along with me. He was so well-trained. I would go into a club to have a couple of beers, and he would lie down on the floor beside me. It's a wonderful feeling knowing that he has your back.
</p><p class="has-image">

</p><p dir="ltr">
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Was it dangerous even outside of the battlefield?<br>
	</strong>Yes. There were potential conflicts with South Vietnamese, but there was a lot of racial tension amongst the US soldiers. That's an unfortunate aspect of it, especially with the infantry guys. You're out in the field, your life's on the line, and then you come back and want to get drunk, blow off steam—some of the guys did drugs—and there would be fights between blacks and whites in the rear. But I tell ya, nobody messed with dog handlers, because we had our dogs with us all of the time. People gave us a lot of space.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong><em data-redactor-tag="em">RELATED: It's Like Vietnam All Over Again</em></strong></p><p><br></p><iframe src="//embeds.vice.com/?playerId=YjMwNmI4YjU2MGM5ZWRjMzRmMjljMjc5&amp;aid=vice.com/americana&amp;vid=o2cDVnODpIj6m8J3hqEfG4C7vokbQwRc&amp;embedCode=o2cDVnODpIj6m8J3hqEfG4C7vokbQwRc&amp;cust_params=embdom%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.vice.com%2Fvideo%2Fits-like-vietnam-all-over-again-full-length%26topic%3Dtravel%26aid%3Dits-like-vietnam-all-over-again-full-length%26auth%3DThomas+Morton%26keywords%3DAmericana%2CVietnam%2Cwar%2Creenactment%2CNorth+Carolina%2CThomas+Morton%26ac%3Dno%26country%3Den_us%26contentId%3Do2cDVnODpIj6m8J3hqEfG4C7vokbQwRc&amp;ad_rule=1&amp;description_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vice.com%2Fvideo%2Fits-like-vietnam-all-over-again-full-length&amp;autoplay=0&amp;share_url=http://www.vice.com/video/its-like-vietnam-all-over-again-full-length" width="1000px" height="562px" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><p dir="ltr">
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	How long did you serve in Vietnam?<br>
	</strong>Just under eight months. A normal tour is a year, but the reason mine was shortened was primarily because our unit was standing down, and they didn't need more dog handlers. This was in March of 1972. I had put in for an early-out to go back to graduate school. So between those two things, I got my tour cut short, which I was thrilled about. The only negative was that I couldn't bring my dog home.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	He wasn't going to be used anymore, and there's no good reason on God's green Earth that we could not have brought our dogs back. We would've paid for them ourselves. I was just an E-4, so I didn't make much money. But I sure would've paid for his flight back, and let him live the rest of his life with me. Because he was only seven years old, so presumably he was only through with half of his life. And yet, he was turned over to the South Vietnamese, who didn't work with us and had no idea how to use these dogs. Cultural issues being what they were, the Vietnamese eat dogs.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	We're sure that's what happened to our dogs that were turned over to the South Vietnamese. That still bothers me greatly to this day. They sacrificed their lives to save ours.
</p><p class="has-image">
	[body_image width='750' height='638' path='images/content-images/2015/05/06/' crop='images/content-images-crops/2015/05/06/' filename='the-us-military-euthanized-or-abandoned-3000-of-their-own-canine-soldiers-at-the-end-of-the-vietnam-war-253-body-image-1430931350.png' id='53402']
</p><p dir="ltr">
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	What was the process like to try and bring your dog home?<br>
	</strong>We made some phone calls while we were over there trying to convince people, saying, "Hey, let us pay for our dogs to come back!" The problem was we didn't have much time to negotiate this, and we didn't want to jeopardize our going home, we wanted to get the hell out of there as quickly as we could. And once we started pushing this, some people came back and said, "If you guys keep jacking around with this thing, you're gonna be staying here." I don't know how much of a hollow threat that was, but it was enough that some of us backed off.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	So it was a set in stone policy of the US military to not bring military dogs home?<br>
	</strong>Yep. Ironically, we had some 40,000 dogs that served in World War II, and all the dogs that were physically able at the end of the war [came home]. Korea, same deal: [The dogs] came home.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	There were some concerns that [the dogs] would pick up diseases; but there was nothing that they could pick up that couldn't be treated. Some people were saying, "These are war dogs! Are they gonna go back to a family situation and freak out when kids start wrestling with them and attack the kids?" No. They can distinguish between war and a home situation. Somebody in Vietnam made the decision that dogs were surplus equipment, and as surplus equipment, they were expendable at war's end. Just like the choppers that we pushed off the aircraft carriers in the South China Sea.
</p><p class="has-image">
	[body_image width='750' height='585' path='images/content-images/2015/05/06/' crop='images/content-images-crops/2015/05/06/' filename='the-us-military-euthanized-or-abandoned-3000-of-their-own-canine-soldiers-at-the-end-of-the-vietnam-war-253-body-image-1430931366.png' id='53403']
</p><p dir="ltr">
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	I understand that of the three thousand "surplus" dogs at the end of the war, some were given over to the South Vietnamese, and others were euthanized by the US government. Do you know how many fall into each camp?<br>
	</strong>No, I never heard statistics on that. My guess is 50/50, but I don't know. I have talked to vet-techs in Vietnam since returning home, who say the toughest thing they ever had to do in their life was stick that needle into a healthy dog, who did nothing more than try to save our lives and protect us.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Do you think any of the dogs that were abandoned made it to good homes?<br>
	</strong>No. I doubt it. Maybe a handful of them were "adopted" by a Vietnamese family, but that would be rare. I think they ate them. I don't think they had any particular affection for these dogs at all, even though these dogs were saving their lives, too. There was an intimidation factor, because these dogs were so big. Even when we were in the field with South Vietnamese, they stayed away from us, they didn't want anything to do with these dogs.
</p><p class="has-image">
	[body_image width='750' height='399' path='images/content-images/2015/05/06/' crop='images/content-images-crops/2015/05/06/' filename='the-us-military-euthanized-or-abandoned-3000-of-their-own-canine-soldiers-at-the-end-of-the-vietnam-war-253-body-image-1430931393.png' id='53404']
</p><p dir="ltr">
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Has the method of working with dogs in the field changed since Vietnam?<br>
	</strong>Oh, yes. When I was in training in 1971, they told me "These aren't pets! You don't play with these dogs!" Well, that's bunk, because we did play with our dogs. We didn't throw balls and things that they could fetch, because if you were out in the field and threw a hand grenade, you don't want the dog bringing it back to you. We didn't have any toys for them. Now they've got little chewy toys and stuff like that, and any dog owner knows how much they love these toys. So, they now officially have playtime.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	And now they wear flak jackets [body armor]. We never had flak jackets on our dogs, because I guess they assumed the dogs weren't coming home anyway, so if they get killed they get killed. Now they have these flak jackets to protect them, because most of the dogs that get killed die of chest wounds.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	They also have a camera on the dogs' harness now. So a handler can send that dog into a house, watch what he's doing on a TV, and communicate to the dog with instructions through a microphone, telling him to go left, right, straight, stay, or sit. The dogs are obedient. They'll follow instructions, and the camera moves around, letting the handler see what's going on in the house. So that keeps the handler out of harm's way in case the dog runs into something in the house. It's really cool.
</p><p class="has-image">
	[body_image width='750' height='475' path='images/content-images/2015/05/06/' crop='images/content-images-crops/2015/05/06/' filename='the-us-military-euthanized-or-abandoned-3000-of-their-own-canine-soldiers-at-the-end-of-the-vietnam-war-253-body-image-1430931413.png' id='53405']
</p><p dir="ltr">
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Was Big Boy on your mind often when you were back home?<br>
	</strong>Yeah. There was certainly trauma for me, leaving my dog there. But it was probably overmatched by the fact that I was happy as heck to be out of Vietnam and out of harm's way, to not be shot at anymore. But yes, I felt horrible for that dog.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	I made some calls to Congressman, and wrote some letters. The problem in Vietnam was that nobody knew that these dogs were left there. Because the only people who knew about this were the dog handlers who wanted to take their dogs back and weren't allowed to do so. A lot of us tried to change that, but nothing happened. It took another war for anything to change.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	President Clinton signed a bill [in 2000] that said no military dog would be left behind. We'd like to think [the dog handlers] had a role in that, and we probably did have a small role, but I think there was enough of an outcry after people found out what had happened to these dogs that it was a no-brainer. In Iraq and Afghanistan, when those dogs either get too old or get wounded, they're not euthanized. They're put up for adoption by their former handler. That's the way it should've been in Vietnam.

	Does exposure breed good vibes? Can hanging out with a person who comes from the opposite side of a political divide create enough connective tissue to bridge that divide? Scientists have long struggled to answer this question. While there is still no conclusive evidence, some relevant data emerged from 
	<a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2014/07/16/how-americans-feel-about-religious-groups/" target="_blank">a recent Pew study</a> that explored how different religions are perceived by Americans. Muslims were viewed the least favorably, Pew found. However, knowing a Muslim seems to have a small effect on reported levels of personal prejudice.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	Matthew Nolan wants to explore—and exploit—that finding to secure peace in the Middle East. The 31-year-old Detroit native now lives in the East Village, where he works as a software developer and dating coach. Most recently, Nolan launched a dating app intended to bring together Israelis and Palestinians. <a href="http://www.getverona.com/" target="_blank">Verona</a>, named for the city where the fighting of the Montagues and the Capulets led to the deaths of Romeo and Juliet, is a Tinder-esque app that matches Palestinians with Israelis.
</p><!--recommended--><p dir="ltr">
	Verona currently has between 1000-2000 users, and the reviews seem very positive, aside from those that are blatantly xenophobic ("This app is for lazy &amp; ugly Arabs, who don't have any chance to find their love mate in other places or apps. If you are looking to be raped and live in daily violence, this app is perfect for you"). VICE spoke to Nolan to learn more about Verona, the tech world, and what a white guy from Detroit has to contribute to peace in the Middle East.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	<strong>VICE: How would you describe the work that you do?<br>
	</strong><strong>Matthew Nolan:</strong> I build software. I'm an artist. Software has become my art, I guess.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	So you're a tech dude.<br>
	</strong>For better or for worse, I'm a tech dude. But I'm a cool tech dude. They've been getting a bad rap. There's a lot of douchey tech guys out there. I'm one of the non-douchey ones. I really like doing things that affect the world in a positive way. Technology, it's like a hairspray bottle: with a little bit of effort, in just the right way and just the right place, you can affect great change, massive change, positive change.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	How did Verona come about?<br>
	</strong>It was at a party after Valentine's Day. I had a bunch of people over, and we were talking about Burning Man and how to use art to make the world a better place. My buddy, who's Palestinian, brought a date who is Israeli, and he said, "We're bringing the world together." I'm like, that's hilarious! Maybe we should do a dating site, like J-P Date, Jewish-Palestinian date. We were laughing about it; we were just having a fun time. But the idea stuck with me, J-P Date. And it's easy—I already have these software skills. So I thought about it, and then after a week, I was like, Yeah, I should just fucking do it. I did the whole thing in a month, less than that, coded the whole thing up.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	When I told people my idea, people were just like, "Dude. That's awesome. Fucking hilarious, you have to do that. That's amazing." My super-hippie/burner/tech friends were all into it. So I started seeking out friends of mine, or friends of friends, who are more conservative, guys at the office who are Israeli and have kids. Everybody thinks that it's hilarious. And nobody's threatened to kill me yet, so I think I'm onto something.

	Do you think there's a cap on how many users you can attract? What about cultural and religious barriers?<br>
	</strong>I'm very flexible with the terminology of Israeli/Palestinian. Even if you're Jewish and you've never been to Israel or you're Arabic but don't have direct ties to Palestine, I still want a selfie of you on a date. My dream is a wall of selfies of people who met on my app. That way, when the propaganda machine over in Israel is saying, "The other side hates us," it just seems more asinine.

	How does Verona work?<br>
	</strong>I'm fascinated by the mating habits of the human being. The problem I have with Tinder is that it's so fundamentally superficial, right? Something interesting about me is, apart from being a software engineer, I am also a professional dating coach. Clients from around the world fly to New York because they have a hard time meeting people, or they are too shy, or too nervous, or they aren't confident enough. They need help in their love life: That's what we do. It's probably one of the most rewarding experiences I've had in my life. It's about helping people develop social skills, a tool set so they can get their own dates. What I'm doing is stripping away blockers for them. It's all about removing insecurities and helping them realize their full potential, that they really are amazing people, and there's no reason they can't get a date, and enabling them to go forth and do that.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	Have you ever had problems approaching women?<br>
	</strong>No. Everyone in the community has the same story: They had a hard time in high school. I always had girlfriends in high school. I never had confidence problems. I am a computer nerd, don't get me wrong! I've got my nerd stripes, I'm a techie, I'm a nerd. But I was DJing as a teenager; I was out and about.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	So Tinder felt wrong. Why?<br>
	</strong>It's so superficial. It's based completely on how a person looks, which has its place. It's a raunchy pick-up app. If all you're looking for is someone based on physical appearances, Tinder serves its purpose. And then a lot of apps go the other way, like OkCupid and Match. They're too psychological; it's not fun, they're like homework.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	For Verona, I want people to have connections with more substance. It's critical that people aren't just hooking up on a superficial level. So my key feature in Verona is, I ask people to identify what in life they're most passionate about. When guys come out when we're coaching them, they're always like, "What's the one pick-up line? What's the one zinger to guarantee you'll get a girl?" And really, the one thing is to say, "Hi," and then ask them [about] what interests them. There's nothing more attractive than somebody being interested in you.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	<strong>What's one way Verona might help those in the Middle East to better understand each other?<br>
	</strong>If you can imagine people over there in the middle of this conflict, I want people to have more to talk about than all this bullshit, who's right and who's wrong. It seems to me that's what the dialogue is: Your people shouldn't have done this, your people have done that. This way, if people are talking about Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, at least there's a lot of common ground established.
</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Do you believe a romantic connection can increase empathy?<br></strong>Before romance ever happens between two people, there first has to be a basic connection. What Verona provides is a venue for that connection to first happen. Verona is just as useful [for making] casual friends, as it is for something deeper. In any relationship, the depth of love is directly proportional to the amount of trust each person is investing. Hypothetically, if you had masses of people forming deep, profound relationships, and investing great trust with individuals on the other "side," the conflict would cease to exist. A cynic might say this notion is naive. I disagree. These kinds of relationships are <a href="http://rt.com/news/175792-jews-arabs-refuse-enemies/" target="_blank">already happening</a>. There just needs to be more of them.</p><p dir="ltr">
	<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">
	What would you say to people who say Jews should only date Jews, or Muslims should only date Muslims?<br>
	</strong>If this app upsets them, don't use it. This app is for people making a choice to date, or even just to communicate, with someone who's different.

	At first glance, what happened to Stephen Fought doesn't seem that unusual by the standards of 
	<a href="http://www.vice.com/read/are-albequerques-police-the-worst-in-the-country" target="_blank">Albuquerque</a>, New Mexico. Fought, who suffers from schizophrenia, <a href="http://www.freeabq.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Vol-II-Issue-8-April-22-2015.pdf" target="_blank">locked himself in a motel room</a> with a gun and refused to come out, so the Albuquerque Police Department sent a SWAT team to get him out. They eventually apprehended Fought, but he says he sustained serious injuries from beanbag rounds and bites from a police dog.
</p><p>
	In a city

But there was one aspect of the arrest that was bizarre even by the standards of Walter White's hometown: According to Fought, police confronted him with a Remotec ANDROS bomb-squad robot, using it to <a href="http://www.cabq.gov/police/documents/monthly-reports/police-reports-november-2014.pdf" target="_blank">launch "chemical munitions</a>" through the motel room window.
</p><p>
	"They sent that robot over there, and I thought, 'Man, what is that?' You know?" Fought said in an interview. "They threw a grenade in there, it started smoking, I threw it back out. They threw another one, I threw it back out. They broke out the window with a, some kind of a ball or something. Some kind of a shell."
</p><p>
	In the depths of schizophrenic delusions, and terrified by the military tactics and equipment employed by the SWAT Team, Fought struggled to keep his cool.
</p><p>
	"I mean, even in the hospital, I went to the hospital, I thought they were gonna kill me at the hospital," he said.
</p><!--recommended--><p>
	It's not the only time Albuquerque's bomb-squad robot has been deployed by the SWAT team, either. Using information from the police department's publicly available monthly reports, VICE identified at least seven instances of the bomb-squad robot being used by Albuquerque's SWAT team. In one case, the robot was used to 
	<a href="http://www.cabq.gov/police/documents/monthly-reports/August_2013_Monthly_Report.pdf" target="_blank">reach in a suicidal man's bedroom window</a> and pull a blanket off of him because the SWAT team was wondering whether he had a gun or not. (Turns out he didn't.)
</p><p>
	Albuquerque Police Department spokesman Tanner Tixier refused to answer any questions, instructing me to instead file a public-records request with the department, which is outstanding. (The department had 
	<a href="http://www.kob.com/article/stories/S3782963.shtml?cat=500#.VUPWctp_Okr" target="_blank">put nearly half of the public records staff</a> on leave right before that conversation last month.)

</p><p>
	The robot takeover spreads far beyond Albuquerque, and their use is 
	<a href="http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2015/04/27/wheelchair-bound-man-in-rancho-cucamonga-allegedly-shoots-wife-holds-her-hostage-for-weeks/" target="_blank">swiftly</a> <a href="http://theadvocate.com/news/neworleans/neworleansnews/12232735-123/report-three-suspects-with-machine" target="_blank">becoming</a> <a href="http://www.mansfieldnewsjournal.com/story/news/local/2015/04/27/mansfield-police-scene-standoff/26457727/" target="_blank">commonplace</a> among SWAT teams nationally. The robots, originally designed for use as bomb-disposal tools, are also becoming increasingly weaponized. Northrop Grumman's Remotec ANDROS F6 robot, for example, can be <a href="http://www.northropgrumman.com/Capabilities/Remotec/Products/Pages/F6AAccessories.aspx" target="_blank">outfitted</a> with an X-ray to look for explosive material, or a "disruptor" to safely detonate bombs. But it can also be fitted with a pepper-spray dispenser, a tear-gas launcher, and even a shotgun.
</p><p>
	Northrop Grumman spokeswoman Janis Lamar told me in an email that over 90 percent of police bomb squads use Remotec robots, with over 1,100 of them deployed across the US. And according to Lamar, the LAPD owns a "heavy-duty" unmanned vehicle, an armored cross between a bulldozer and a crane known as the BatCat. A 
	<a href="http://www.northropgrumman.com/Capabilities/Remotec/Products/Pages/ZHeavyDuty.aspx" target="_blank">video demonstration</a> on Northrop Grumman's website shows the BatCat lifting a van and then tearing down the wall of a building.
</p><p>
	Now a new generation of robots is on the way, with some of the work being done in Albuquerque. The federally-funded Sandia National Laboratories, located just outside the city limits, is hard at work on some of the most cutting-edge robotics programs in the nation. During a tour of Sandia's facilities, I was shown two robots under development, the Gemini-Scout and the STEPPR. The Gemini-Scout is a three-foot-high robot on tank treads, designed to enter mines on search-and-rescue missions. The STEPPR is a bipedal robot also intended for disaster response which has been under development since Japan's Fukushima disaster in 2011.

</iframe><hr><p>
	Although Sandia is not developing the robots for police or military use, they could certainly be modified by police departments after the fact.
</p><p>
	"As the technology evolves, the capability will be there," said Steve Buerger, a principal member of Sandia's R&amp;D staff working on the STEPPR. "There's obviously a lot of uses for these technologies and a lot of issues to work through in terms of the best way to use them. But I think there are some very positive uses like emergency response or explosive ordinance disposal."
</p><p>
	Still, it'll be a long time before a walking robocop knocks on your door, according to Buerger.
</p><p>
	"The system's like this: It's taking a few steps and trying not to fall," he said. "The technology really has a long way to go before it's useful in a lot of the application spaces that might require a more robust system."
</p><p>
	Jake Deuel, Sandia's Robotic and Security Systems manager, said robots aren't usually developed with local police forces in mind, but that may change.
</p><p>
	"Typically, they don't have the resources to be able to fund research at a lab," he said. "But now with like the Department of Homeland Security, there's ways that if your local police department said they really need something through DHS or the Science and Technology Department, there's ways they could make requests that, 'We need a robot to be able to do this.'"

</p><p>
	Indeed, the expanded use of robots seems to track with a general trend of federally supported police militarization. Through initiatives like the Pentagon's 
	<a href="http://www.vice.com/read/the-pentagon-is-giving-grenade-launchers-to-campus-police-904" target="_blank">1033 program</a>, the military has been transferring war gear to civilian police departments in the US. According to the ACLU, close to 500 bomb-disposal robots have been transferred to police departments through the program. (It's worth noting that President Obama this week <a href="https://news.vice.com/article/the-military-equipment-gravy-train-is-ending-for-local-police-departments" target="_blank">announced plans</a> to rein in federal militarization of local police, at least in the case of some of the scariest devices, like grenade launchers.)
</p><p>
	ACLU Legislative Council Kanya Bennett told VICE that the Department of Defense claims all weaponry is removed from the robots before they are transferred to local police departments, but there's no reason the departments can't purchase the weaponry from Northrop Grumman or another supplier and attach it themselves.
</p><p>
	"We have law enforcement receiving all kinds of military weapons, all kinds of military equipment that it has no idea what to do with. And then kind of configures for its own purposes," she said. "We certainly believe that some of this equipment should not be in the hands of state and locals to begin with, so that's a problem in itself."
</p><p>
	Bennett said the use of robots raises serious concerns, as it removes officers and departments even further from life-or-death decisions that impact community members.
</p><p>
	"We're having a difficult time holding our traditional—our human—police officers accountable in recent months," she said. "So I'm certainly concerned with introducing additional technology where there's even less accountability."
</p><p>
	Stanford Law professor and police-militarization expert David Sklansky said that while there are legitimate uses for robots in policing, there are also plenty of legit concerns.
</p><p>
	"If you have an officer on the phone and you have a probe that's going in to make sure that things are safe, there are gonna be situations where I think that's appropriate," he said. "Now, if you start putting weapons on the machines, that raises the stakes dramatically... Weapons are dangerous enough in human hands. When you start talking about operating them remotely, you create, obviously, new possibilities for mistakes and accidents."
</p><p>
	And mistakes certainly do happen. In Tennessee several years ago, a <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/06/01/police_robot_burns_down_house/" target="_blank">police robot</a> accidentally burned down a man's home.
</p><p>
	The challenge for law enforcement and police reformers, then, will be to balance what seems like a pretty obvious need for modern tools with what has become an intense national conversation about militarized policing in America.

<title>How Will Cleveland Respond to the Michael Brelo Verdict?</title>

<description><![CDATA[<p>
	Cleveland's Justice Center is a concrete block just south of the Lake Erie shoreline done in a shade of beige that always looks in need of a good pressure washing. Narrow windows run the building's latitude and give it the slightly menacing look of partially-open venetian blinds, out of which some unseen force might be peering.
</p><p>
	Inside, Cleveland Police Officer Michael Brelo, who had been standing trial for voluntary manslaughter in the deaths of two unarmed black suspects, was found not guilty Saturday of all charges lodged against him. In an hour-long explanation of the ruling, Judge John O'Donnell said that prosecutors had not proved "beyond a reasonable doubt" that Brelo "knowingly caused the deaths of Timothy Russell and Malissa Williams" by jumping on the hood of their car and firing at least 15 rounds through the windshield in November 2012.
	Five Cleveland Police Supervisors have also been <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2014/05/five_cleveland_police_supervio.html" target="_blank">charged</a> with dereliction of duty, though their trial dates have not yet been set. 
</p><p>
	The judge decided that the prosecution failed to show that Brelo—who with a dozen other officers unleashed a total of 137 rounds—had fired the decisive shots, and further determined that from Brelo's perspective that night, the shots were justifiable.
</p><p>
	The verdict hits the city six months after the 
	<a href="http://www.vice.com/read/we-talked-to-clevelanders-about-12-year-old-tamir-rices-death-at-the-hands-of-police-1201" target="_blank">shooting
of Tamir Rice
	</a>. The initial investigation into the 12-year-old's death is still underway,
a fact that has drawn ire from local and national civil rights advocates. A
protest in Rice's name is scheduled for 
	<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2015/05/tamir_rice_rally_at_impett_par.html#incart_maj-story-1" target="_blank">Saturday afternoon</a>, as is a counter protest, the latest spark in a decades-long struggle over local policing practices.
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	<!--recommended-->
	The story of the Brelo trial, which has been followed
closely by Clevelanders, actually begins where it ended Saturday, at a spot just across from
the court complex on Lakeside Avenue that's 
	<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2015/04/everything_you_need_to_know_be.html" target="_blank">known</a>
	for drug deals. On the night of November 29, 2012, Timothy Russell and Malissa
Williams visited that spot in a 1979 Chevy Malibu. Russell,
43, and Williams, 30, 
	<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2014/11/in_life_malissa_williams_strug.html" target="_blank">knew each other</a> from a homeless shelter on Superior Avenue where they both got
free meals. She
was a 
	<a href="http://www.dispatch.com/content/downloads/2013/02/officer-involved-shooting.pdf" target="_blank">diagnosed</a>
	paranoid schizophrenic and he <a href="http://www.newsnet5.com/news/local-news/cleveland-metro/siblings-of-timothy-russell-testify-in-cleveland-police-officer-michael-brelos-trial" target="_blank">suffered</a>
	from bipolar disorder. Both
had long struggled with addiction, and they were out that night to score, which
they did.
</p><p>
	Eventually, after their bodies had been riddled with bullets and removed from the car, police would find a crack pipe, and toxicology reports would go on to
indicate that each had cocaine and other drugs in their systems.
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	Around 10:30 PM, a plainclothes cop ran the car's plates,
and when nothing showed up, attempted to pull it over for a turn signal
violation. Russell,
who'd had 
	<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2012/12/fleeing_driver_shot_by_police.html" target="_blank">run-ins with the police</a> before, decided to make a break for it. As he
did, there was a noise officers thought sounded like a gunshot. An
expert at trial 
	<a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2015/04/20/expert-witness-says-officer-wrong-fire-final-shots-suspects-killing/ofh7Of0f5YKT7jw1Ir686N/story.html" target="_blank">later concluded</a>
	that the car had backfired. Russell
sped through Public Square, over the Detroit Superior Bridge, which spans the
Cuyahoga River, and headed into Cleveland's West Side. 
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	Over the course of the next 23 minutes, Russell 
	<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2012/12/follow_deadly_chase_across_cle.html" target="_blank">would take</a> police on a high-speed tour of the city, dipping slightly south
towards Steelyard Commons before getting on I-90 and heading east. Sixty-two
police cars eventually joined in the chase, which reached speeds of 100 mph.
Russell finally came to a stop in the city of East Cleveland, cornered by
police near a middle school. Cops 
	<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2015/04/everything_you_need_to_know_be.html" target="_blank">later said</a> that the car was trying to run them over and someone thought they saw
a gun. Officers fired and the shooting continued until 13 of them had discharged
the 137 bullets.  
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	Officer Michael Brelo emptied 49 bullets from his service
weapon into the car; the final rounds, a fellow officer 
	<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2015/04/officer_testifies_to_seeing_so.html" target="_blank">later testified</a>, came when Brelo jumped on the hood of the Malibu and fired
directly downwards onto Russell and Williams. A
gun was never found on either of them.</p><p class="pullquote">"This assumption of violence is at the core of what people are pissed off about." </p><p>In the wake of protests in Baltimore and Ferguson, the City
of Cleveland began issuing statements about public safety and the verdict's
announcement last week. Children 
	<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2015/05/cleveland_schools_say_parents.html" target="_blank">could</a>
	stay home from school after the verdict, they said, and
neighborhood listservs sent out the locations of designated "safe houses" where
residents could shelter in the event of rioting. Local news 
	<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2015/05/clevelands_riot_prevention_pla.html" target="_blank">reported</a>
	that city officials were sitting down with coaches, motorcycle club leaders,
pastors, and former gang members to talk about violence prevention.
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	In late April, as the trial wrapped up, local news outlets 
	<a href="http://www.wkyc.com/story/news/local/cleveland/2015/04/29/riot-gear/26583635/" target="_blank">reported</a>
	that the police department had issued orders for officers to come to work
prepared with protective gear, including helmets and shields.
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	Implicit in the city's preparations for the Brelo verdict is
a fear that the cumulative effects of a year of bad news about the police use
of excessive force—the Department of Justice issued a damning 
	<a href="http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2014/12/04/cleveland_division_of_police_findings_letter.pdf" target="_blank">report</a>
	on Cleveland in late 2014, prompted in part by the deaths of Russell Williams—could
bubble over. 
	<a href="http://www.vice.com/read/criminal-justice-reformer-vanita-gupta-just-got-way-more-powerful-1016" target="_blank">Vanita Gupta</a>, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights
Division, issued a 
	<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2015/05/justice_department_will_contin.html" target="_blank">statement</a>
	following the Brelo verdict that she and her team would "now review the
testimony and evidence presented in the state trial."  
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	Erika Anthony, senior director of advocacy and policy for
Cleveland Neighborhood Progress, a community development organization, and Evelyn
Burnett, the group's Vice President of Economic Opportunity, attended
outreach meetings conducted by officials in recent days. They hope the city's
abundance-of-caution response doesn't hinder any lawful protests in the wake of
the verdict's announcement. 
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	"One of the questions that I've been pressing in
meetings is the difference between a protest and a riot," Anthony said.
"You can't deny citizens the right to meet or galvanize in a group if
they're not doing something violent. You can't stop that, and I think the messages
have been mixed as far as what the city wants people to do or not do."
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	Burnett says she doesn't think that the city is wrong to be prepared,
but added that the investment of attention in the potential for rioting has
pushed off discussions about the city's more systemic issues. Early last week, Cleveland City Councilman Kevin Conwell of the majority-black Glenville neighborhood was 
	<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/morris/index.ssf/2015/05/councilman_kevin_conwells_clev.html" target="_blank">misquoted</a> in a NPR story, saying that he would "riot the neighborhood for three days after the verdict if he's acquitted. I have to riot. I have to show leadership. Conwell actually <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/05/18/407619638/cleveland-braces-for-verdict-in-2012-police-">said</a> "ride" and NPR later corrected its account.
</p><p>
	"This assumption of
violence is at the core of what people are pissed off about," Burnett said.
"This implicit bias that then leads to this implicit fear of us, all the time. That's what black folks are saying—why do you
continue to be so afraid of me to the point that it gives you immunity if you
take my life?"
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	Foremost in the minds of many Cleveland activists are not riots, but
rather the terms of an agreement between the feds and the city to address its
policing problems. 
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	The DOJ's December 2014 report found that "CDP officers too frequently
resort to a type of force that is unreasonable in light of the resistance or
threat encountered." The consent decree, as it is known, is essentially a
settlement in which the city agrees to take steps toward halting its violations. An independent monitor,
as yet unnamed, 
	<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/cityhall/index.ssf/2015/03/justice_department_and_city_of.html" target="_blank">will be appointed</a> to oversee the process,
a nod to the fact that 
	<a href="http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2014/12/04/cleveland_division_of_police_findings_letter.pdf" target="_blank">recommendations</a> from a
similar 2004 DOJ report about the city's policing practices, "were either not
fully implemented or, if implemented, were not maintained over time."
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	David Malik, a civil rights attorney who represented the family of
Malissa Williams in its successful $3 million lawsuit against the city, said he hopes to
see more rigorous training for officers and dispatchers, along with better
communications equipment. Halfway through the chase that ended in
the deaths of Russell and Williams, some officers can be heard on tape telling
dispatchers, "He does not have a gun in his hand" and, "There's a
red pop can in his hand, be advised." The information seems to have been lost in the chaos of the pursuit.
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	Will Cooper, a former Cleveland Police Sergeant who was with the
department from 1981 until his retirement in 2011, said in an interview that the city uses what
he calls an "antiquated" dispatch system. "Cars can't speak to each other, lots of time the dispatchers can't speak
to the cars," he told me. 
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	<b> </b>The Justice Department noticed these problems. It found that not all cars
have computers that let them communicate properly with dispatchers, and, 
	<b>"</b>of those that do, the computers do not all reliably
work." Police sometimes can't access information about the nature of calls they
get—in the Tamir Rice shooting, the officers who arrived at the scene 
	<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/23/us/in-tamir-rice-shooting-in-cleveland-many-errors-by-police-then-a-fatal-one.html" target="_blank">didn't
receive
	</a> the initial 911 caller's 
	<a href="http://www.wkyc.com/story/news/local/cleveland/2014/11/24/listen--911-caller-reports-tamir-rice-incident/19479083/" target="_blank">caveat</a> that the gun the 12-year-old was carrying was
"probably fake," and that Rice was "probably a juvenile."
</p><p>
	Officers sometimes rely on personal cell phones to
receive and collect information, using them to take photographs and send text
messages, potential evidence in criminal cases. The DOJ's report noted that
this was legally hazy territory and that
	<b data-redactor-tag="b">
	</b>"CDP has no protocol in place for how such evidence will be handled,
preserved, or disclosed to prosecutors and defense attorneys."
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	A Cleveland police spokesperson said in
an email that an update the to current dispatch system, which dates to 2009, is "in
the works" and "could possibly occur this year."
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	Malik, the civil rights attorney, also pointed to the importance of greater transparency and said that
the department currently operates in a climate of "wholesale lack of accountability." 
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	"There is a paucity of analytical data collected on the performance of
officers in Cleveland," he said. "There needs to be a database that tracks
officer complaints and tracks officer commendations." 
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	He added that Timothy Loehmann, the officer who shot Rice, had received poor marks on his handgun abilities at his previous post
with a suburban department—his skills were "dismal," 
	<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2014/12/cleveland_police_officer_who_s.html" target="_blank">according</a> to an
evaluation, and he became "distracted" and "weepy" during
the course of training. He
was still hired by the Cleveland Police.
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	Another excessive force incident by
Cleveland Police in 2011 only came to light after an anonymous source leaked 
	<a href="http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2011/11/cleveland_police_kick_suspect.html" target="_blank">video</a> from a police
helicopter showing the beating of 41-year-old Edward Henderson after he led
police on a chase. Henderson, who sustained a detached retina and broken eye socket, was 
	<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2013/07/edward_henderson_awarded_60000.html" target="_blank">awarded</a>
	$600,000 in damages from the city. He <a href="http://blog.cleveland.com/metro/2011/02/police_investigate_incident_cl.html" target="_blank">told</a> the <i>Cleveland Plain Dealer</i> that cops laughed as they
beat him, and said they would blame his injuries on a car crash. Their incident
report included no notes that force had been used. 
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	Cooper, the former Cleveland cop, says the nature of
the police department changed drastically during his tenure, and that most
officers on the force when he started out had been shaped by the tumultuous
events of the late 1960s and 1970s. 
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	"They were very careful about starting something
that couldn't be controlled," he said. "Within their experience, they got shot
at, the snipers tried to take them out. Hough and Glenville"—neighborhoods that
saw large-scale rioting, 
	<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=QDgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=fred+ahmed+evans+sniper&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SmFzubo_Pu&amp;sig=7fUO1WSSQsl7tGexMRPHpz2OmVs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c9RgVdfXCtKVyAS9n4DYBw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=fred%20ahmed%20evans%20sniper&amp;f=false" target="_blank">including sniper fire</a>, in 1966 and 1968—"had an extreme effect on these guys."
</p><p>
	Cooper said there was a shift in tenor during the 1990s and 2000s. 
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	"Some of the Iraq War-era veterans who had a
tremendous, terrible experience over there, they come over here and your
department starts to become more militarized. There's a detachment, there's a
retreat from the community policing concept of things."
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="pullquote">
	Before she died, Malissa Williams had at least 46 run-ins with the criminal justice system.
</p><p>
	In the
days leading up to the verdict, many on the ground in Cleveland expected the
Brelo announcement to pass peacefully, and not just because of the city's
preemptive actions. "I think the
community is too passive to have a Ferguson or a Baltimore," Erika Anthony
	<b> </b>said<b data-redactor-tag="b">.
	</b>She and Burnett cite disillusionment with city politics in particular—a <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/cityhall/index.ssf/2015/05/activists_launch_petition_driv.html#incart_m-rpt-1" target="_blank">movement</a> has been afoot for
the past several months to recall three-term Mayor Frank Jackson.
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	Efforts have sprung up aiming to clue Cleveland
citizens into the implementation of federally-mandated police reforms. Burnett
and Anthony are part of a collective looking to develop a digital platform that
will provide information on the DOJ consent agreement and track the progress of
any reform efforts. "Our tax dollars will pay for this consent agreement one
way or another," Burnett said. "One major outcome is people taking back
ownership of their government and their elected officials."
	<b><o:p></o:p></b>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	It remains a fact of life for many Cleveland residents—a
city where 35 percent of the population lives 
	<a href="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/39/3916000.html" target="_blank">below</a> the poverty line—that
police are the both a threat and the most common route to crucial public services
like mental health counseling. Before she died, Malissa Williams had at least 46 run-ins with the criminal justice system. She had been arrested on
prostitution charges—the 
	<i>Plain Dealer</i>
	<a href="http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2012/12/woman_killed_after_car_chase_f.html">reported</a> that in a police
sting, she had offered to perform sex acts in a car for $20. But most of the calls to police were
reporting disturbances related to her schizophrenia, including those from
distraught relatives. Williams was homeless at the end of her life, but not
without family.

	Ireland has made history today by voting overwhelmingly in favor of a proposal to allow 
	<a href="https://www.vice.com/tag/gay%20marriage" target="_blank">gay marriage</a>. It will become the 19th country in the world to recognize gay marriage, the 14th in Europe, and the first to ever do so by popular vote.

	In some parts of Dublin, the Yes vote ran as high as 80 percent. Even in what would be considered the most conservative and religious areas of Ireland, Yes is consistently winning victories.

Not longer afterwards, prominent No campaign group Mothers and Fathers Matter conceded that the Yes campaign had won.

	David Quinn, Director of IONA Institute, went on to reassure the still numerically significant No voters, "Going forward, we will continue to affirm the importance of the biological ties and of motherhood and fatherhood. We hope the Government will address the concerns voters on the No side have about the implications for freedom of religion and freedom of conscience."
</p><p dir="ltr">
	From the Yes coalition, in a release sent to VICE, Michael Barron, the founder of Belong To, spoke of the importance of the today's outcome: "We've changed forever what it means to grow up LGBT in Ireland. The Irish people, via the ballot box, have today given each and every gay child and young person in Ireland—and across the world—a strong and powerful message that they are loved, they are cared for, and don't need to change who they are.

	Mary Cunningham, Director of the National Youth Council of Ireland told VICE, "Over, the past few months we've seen over 100,000 people—primarily young people, students, and first time voters—registering and getting ready to use their voices for good, for love. They came from all over the world to be here today, and the future of Ireland is brighter and better because of them."

	Across the country, Yes supporters begin their celebrations, as the results continue to trickle in. In the next few days there will be much analysis and commentary, but conversation may slowly begin to turn to Northern Ireland, the last province on both islands that does not legally recognize gay marriage.

	Gary Smith lay in an fMRI scanner as a series of pre-programmed questions appear on the screen in front of him, at five second intervals.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	 "Did you share an apartment with Mike McQueen?"
</p><p dir="ltr">
	"Did you shoot Mike McQueen with a revolver?"
</p><p dir="ltr">
	"Did you kill Mike McQueen?"
</p><p dir="ltr">
	In response to each question, Smith clicked a button to indicate "yes" or "no," but as the scientists who designed the test later explained to me, his manual answers were largely irrelevant. The real objective was to monitor the processes taking place in his brain.
</p><!--recommended--><p dir="ltr">
	Smith, a 33-year old former US Army sergeant who served on two tours of Afghanistan, is now at the center of one of Maryland's most complex and prolonged <a href="http://www.vice.com/tag/Murder" target="_blank">murder</a> cases in recent history. In September 2006, Smith's roommate, former army ranger Michael McQueen, was found shot dead in their shared apartment.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	Two separate juries have already convicted Smith of second-degree murder, initially in 2008 and then again in 2012, with sentences of 35 and 28 years respectively. Both have since been overturned on appeal; later this year, Smith will stand trial for a third time.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	With little concrete evidence to support either the defense or the prosecution, the objective of the fMRI scans is to determine whether Smith's claim of innocence is the truth, or a lie.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	During both trials, Smith claimed he spent the night drinking, smoking marijuana, and playing pool with McQueen. After dropping him at home, he left the apartment; on returning, he found McQueen's body in an armchair—an apparent suicide. McQueen's girlfriend since high school had recently left him, and after a drunk driving conviction, he was concerned about his job prospects.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	But it was Smith's gun that fired the fatal shot. During questioning, he gave three versions of events to police officers, initially suggesting that McQueen may have been murdered by local Hispanic men. Most incriminatingly, in the eyes of the prosecution, he disposed of the gun before police arrived and only confessed to doing so after ten hours of interrogation. However, for nine years, Smith has insisted he did not kill McQueen. He says he initially tried to make the crime scene appear like a murder, because he didn't want his friend to be remembered as someone who killed himself.
</p><p dir="ltr">

</p><p dir="ltr">
	The prosecution and McQueen's family believe Smith is lying. Prosecutors have pointed out that he was heavily traumatized by what he witnessed in the Middle East. During his first trial, Smith was diagnosed with PTSD.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	Two trials have yielded little hard evidence to prove Smith's guilt or innocence, but in the mind of Joel Huizenga, CEO of a company called Truthful Brain, there is no doubt. He is convinced Smith is completely innocent.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	Huizenga's company and a team of independent experts conducted the fMRI scans on Smith's brain while questioning him about the events of that night. They were looking for certain patterns of activity that would indicate he might be lying.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	"Deliberately lying is hard work," Huizenga told VICE. "When you're telling the truth, you're just retrieving a memory. But when you lie you have to bring back the truth first and then manipulate it and doing that requires much more of the brain to be active. This means blood rushes to specific areas which are never really used when you're being truthful, and the fMRI allows us to detect these relative changes of blood flow."
</p><p dir="ltr">
	Huizenga initially asked Smith to intentionally lie in response to simple questions about his age and place of birth to get an idea of what his brain looks like when he's lying. Then he compared those scans to the ones taken while he was questioned about McQueen.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	 "In my opinion, they show beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is innocent. Everything about the scans is completely clean," Huizenga says. "None of the brain areas associated with lying light up whatsoever when he's asked about killing his room-mate."
</p><p dir="ltr">
	But these scans will not be shown to the jury when Smith is tried again later this year. Last month, his attorney requested a new 
	<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/frye_standard">Frye hearing</a>, a proceeding which determines whether new technology can be used as evidence in a court of law. The request was denied.

</p><p dir="ltr">
	The 
	<a href="http://mdcourts.gov/opinions/coa/2011/10a11.pdf">previous Frye hearing</a>, which took place ahead Smith's 2012 trial, was the most comprehensive legal review of fMRI 'lie detection' in the legal system so far. Ultimately, it ended in rejection.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	"The legal decision is based on whether fMRI lie detection has been completely accepted in the scientific community and that's not the case right now," explained Gary Gibson, a professor at California Western School of Law, in an interview with VICE.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	"You have scientists saying it's great, but there are others saying the brain is too variable and it isn't reliable. If an analyst runs a DNA sample, you'll get the same result one thousand times in a row. Is that the case for fMRI? We don't know and judges are going to be conservative as we've let a boatload of unreliable science in courts before. Look at the FBI's retractions of bullet lead and hair sample analysis. Those technologies were admitted despite thousands of inconsistent results and now they've had to be pulled. So people are going to be cautious."
</p><p dir="ltr">
	Frank Haist is a cognitive neuroscientist in the Psychiatry Department at the University of California, who has testified as an expert witness in Smith's case, arguing for the use of brain imaging data. He believes that the prosecution resisted particularly strongly as it was a trial by jury.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	"If the defense entered this kind of information, I think jurors would find it particularly compelling," Haist explained. "It would make a whole lot of sense to them. While the prosecution could put out counter-evidence, it's very approachable science so that's why they want to keep it out."
</p><p dir="ltr">
	Haist believes the fMRI data is far more valid than much of the scientific evidence which has been presented during the two trials so far.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	"There was an expert on the prosecution side who argued that the pattern of blood flow splatter from the victim was consistent with a gunshot at a particular angle from a particular distance, while an expert for the defense said it was more consistent with a suicide. Personally I would suggest that the forensic validity of blood splatter analysis is highly questionable. So the decision to allow something like that in, and exclude the fMRI analysis seemed rather arbitrary."
</p><p dir="ltr">
	The opponents of brain scan lie detection argue that it remains too vulnerable to countermeasures, which can beat the system.
	<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21111834">One study</a> done by the Harvard Medical School found that participants could obscure the ability to detect deception by making subtle motor movements during key points in testing.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	"The countermeasure reduced the ability to detect deception, but they didn't eliminate it completely," Haist says. "It was still possible to tell they were lying. The field is still maturing and with improvements in pattern recognition, it will get to the point where we can exclude all the possibility of any counter-measure working. It's also important to look at particular personality styles such as sociopaths. Can they mask lying better than the typical person because they're delusional? That's an open question. We haven't done research in the deception field to decide conclusively whether the technology could be more than 90 percent accurate in those cases."

	Huizenga believes the technology is up to the challenge but the problem is finding the funds to conduct such studies. "What would be the best for the field is if a government puts up the money for a study involving 1,000 people. That's only thing that people can hold against it at the moment, the study size work is small."
</p><p dir="ltr">
	Outside of the courtroom, the demand for brain scan detectors is steadily increasing, with
	<a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140820005871/en/Florida-State-Police-Signs-Contract-Implement-Brain#.VVlFSPlViko">Florida State police</a> signing up to use 'brain fingerprinting' technology last year. Many believe it will soon replace polygraphs as the lie detection method of choice.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	"Polygraphs simply look at whether you're anxious or nervous and they're pretty good at telling that," Huizenga says. "But the leap of faith is from being anxious to telling a lie and that's why they're only
	<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1006610329284#page-1">60 percent accurate</a>. There are people who are anxious when they're telling the truth. And they're easy to manipulate. You can beat a polygraph through simple techniques like taking a beta-blocker."
</p><p dir="ltr">
	Currently, polygraphs are used hundreds of thousands of times a year across the US but given their low accuracy rate, Gibson says the final judgement often comes down to the polygraph operator rather than the data itself. He believes that if the CIA and national security agencies switch to using fMRI instead, that could start the ball rolling for the technology to be accepted in court.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	"There has been interest and that would be the vindication that it's passed beyond theoretical. In any case, sooner or later you're going to find a judge that's going to admit it. It just takes one judge in one state to start the ball rolling and that could happen in six months or six years. Frankly, I think the way it's going to get into court is going to be through a civil application, not a criminal application because the stakes are [lower]. You're only talking about money, not freedom."
</p><p dir="ltr">
	But such a decision will undoubtedly come too late for Smith, who will discover his fate for a third time, by the end of 2015.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	"I believe that if admitted, the fMRI evidence would have tipped it in his favor, since he's been consistent with the 'I didn't shoot him,' story," Gibson says.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	Haist feels the evidence should have been presented at trial but he is agnostic as to whether Smith is really innocent or guilty.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	"He says he's not lying, that he did not kill his room-mate and I believe the data is consistent with that. But I can't say that evidence alone should exonerate him. I don't think that the science is there yet to allow that kind of determination by itself. It still has to be taken in the context of all the other data and there was a lot of unusual behavior that night, which is difficult to explain. In any court, it has to be the weight of evidence, rather than any single piece of evidence, which ultimately counts."

<title>Bette Midler Sang TLC&#039;s &quot;Waterfalls&quot; on Her Divine Intervention Tour</title>

	You know how they say that, in life, you just have to "find your tribe"? After my evening at the Bette Midler <em>Divine Intervention</em> show in <a href="http://www.vice.com/tag/Atlanta" target="_blank">Atlanta</a>, I finally know what that means. I knew it as soon as my brave photographer and I sidled up to a bar near the arena and found two women with thick Southern accents double-fisting tall iced teas and beers. A mother-daughter duo and <em>Beaches</em> mega-fans, they were beyond stoked for the imminent show. Philips Arena was thick with the aroma of rose perfume and familial debt being paid—it was fairly clear most were there as the result of a Mother's Day gift. I found my seat slung low in the rafters and caught someone noting a pattern in the crowd. "Every fifth person doesn't have wine in their hand," said the voice behind me which I couldn't easily determine as annoyed or impressed. (Let's go with impressed.)
</p><p dir="ltr">The stadium peddled plastic wine glasses with thick stems and lids that'd snap into place, should the show physically move you (good planning). The audience was mostly women in their late-40s to mid-60s with a few offspring in tow. I saw a good number of illuminated smartphone screens below, text magnified so large I could read full exchanges from rows away. (One woman's friend recently went into successful remission! "Amen &amp; amen," she responded.) To my right, a lady in a sparkling cardigan loudly whispered to her friend that the secret to a night's peaceful sleep is half a bar of Xanax before bed.</p><p dir="ltr">
	Yes, this was certainly my tribe.
</p><!--recommended--><p dir="ltr">
	Lights softened and dimmed. A purple tornado swirled across a dramatic light show, eventually leading to the drawn curtain and Midler spectacularly emerging from an arm chair embedded in the storm's destruction and trash. Her trio of dancers literally crawled from the fake tornado's debris. Midler wore a dazzling navy sequin two-piece that mimicked a catsuit, moving with the ease and enthusiasm of a teen who just passed her driver's exam on the first go.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	Her energy and her footwear were enviable. She cracked a few jokes about preparing for the show by standing in a refrigerator for hours to "firm up" and worked in a loving jab at her fans and their night blindness (which is at least true for this 27-year-old). Midler was wrapped in what was essentially plastic wrap topped with heavier pieces of plastic, sprinting up and down the stage in heels. The Divine Miss M is days away from 70. These kinds of efforts—and the poise with which she pulled them off—was fucking witchcraft.

</p><p dir="ltr">
	I must admit 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7p0BNt7NHs" target="_blank">my own personal Bette Midler education</a> kicked off with 1993's Disney cult classic <em>Hocus Pocus</em>. Why Disney actually made this movie, I don't need to know. Although mostly regarded as a children's film, it still has fairly adult and/or menacing topics central to its plot line: It's about a trio of Satan worshippers brought back to life because a young VIRGIN (that part is important) teen trespassed and lit a candle that may or may not have been crafted from human fat. I was about seven when I first saw this film and it gave me nightmares that occasionally flare up in variations today. My ensuing obsession with witches, combined with a Catholic upbringing and living on an actual swamp, made me a perpetually nervous child with a gruesome interest in cross-themed jewelry and spooky oak trees. Eventually, <em>Hocus Pocus</em> became less of a scarring blip in my childhood memory and more of a platform to appreciate really excellent musical theater (and <a href="http://i.giphy.com/NhH2mNrGZNVwk.gif" target="_blank">SJP's equally excellent dark reddish-brown lip color</a>).
</p><p dir="ltr" class="pullquote">Midler even covered motherfucking TLC's "Waterfalls." I actually cried at this point.</p><p dir="ltr">Over the course of Bette's career, she's sold close to 30 million albums. She started doing world tours performing her comedy, songs, dance, and general badassitude in 1980. Bette did several residencies performing in Vegas, too, but <em>Divine Intervention </em>is her first tour in a decade—and the first time her beloved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_vdlhsvI1M" target="_blank">Delores the Mermaid</a> character didn't make a cameo in its over 30-year existence. ("Did you REALLY think I'd wedge myself into that fucking fishtail?" Bette quipped.) </p><p dir="ltr"><em><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">RELATED: Check out Noisey's interview with <a href="http://noisey.vice.com/blog/holly-herndons-profile-interview-2015" target="_blank">Holly Herndon</a></strong></em><strong><br></strong></p><p dir="ltr">The tour's stop at Atlanta's Philips Arena looked nearly sold-out to me, with the majority of the venue's 18,238 seats stuffed with wine-drunk moms and grandmoms armed with Instagram. Bette was on stage shimmying around, talking about giving dudes boners, likening herself to vodka. She cued the dancers to pull some sort of magic cord that transformed their outfits into something a middle school girl might wear on her first non-chaperoned trip to the mall.</p><p dir="ltr">They performed "I've Still Got My Health" and it's clear Midler ain't lying. According to, well, Midler, she still hasn't had any work done. Her hair looked like something <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TOxhzAm7fY" target="_blank">Frenchie</a> would have style if she had actually graduated from beauty school. A Jumbovision close-up on her face looked like a candle (made of paraffin, not human fat) that's been burning for about an hour—soft, natural, albeit a little worn. She looked how a 69-year-old woman ought to—only slightly better. Remember, guys, Midler started her stage career on Broadway in 1965. She is a vet—in a youth-obsessed industry, it takes a pro to keep packing out cavernous arenas four decades after her teeth-cutting days.
</p><p class="has-image">

</p><p dir="ltr">
	Midler did a few slow numbers—some with her gals, some solo, but all with her fabulous backing band (many members of which were local). Then it grew even more glorious when she got all fabulously femme, girl power preachin' and covered The Exciters' "Tell Him" as her backup singers/dancers spun like delirious pink lampshades. Honestly, Midler danced her ass off for six songs (including a line dance) before taking a stool for the seventh song and still, the Jumbovision hardly detected any glistening of sweat.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	Midler even covered motherfucking TLC's "Waterfalls." Remember, this was in Atlanta, TLC's hometown. I actually cried at this point. Then she discussed the politics of dick pics and compared them to "mug shots of little old bald men," which, true.</p><p dir="ltr">
	Eerie instrumentals filled the dark stage during a moment of still and then—I physically emitted a sob as Bette began the Screamin' Jay Hawkins' number from 
	<em>Hocus Pocus, "</em>I Put a Spell on You." I took a million photos and texted them to my sister, who thoughtfully responded, "I hope you're getting scared."
</p><p class="has-image">
	[body_image width='1200' height='798' path='images/content-images/2015/05/20/' crop='images/content-images-crops/2015/05/20/' filename='bette-midler-still-bewitches-on-her-divine-intervention-tour-body-image-1432132686.jpg' id='58109']
</p><p dir="ltr">
	Miss M didn't miss a beat or slow her manic roll on my watch. She changed into a pair of Louboutins and talked about dudes who were bad at making her cum. She plowed through a long list of other numbers including a cover of the Rolling Stones' "Beast of Burden" and a tap dance routine in which she swapped out her hot pink sequin gown for what looked like an egg costume. She was on fire. I looked around the arena: The elation over Bette's performance was palpable. </p><p dir="ltr">
	At the end of the show, despite sitting completely still while watching another person run through a grueling 25-song setlist in two hours, I felt totally zonked. I stood slumped, transfixed as a golden radio memory from my childhood took living form. Bette leaned forward, baring a sincere-looking smile as "Wind Beneath My Wings" rolled out like some velvety vomit. I left before the encore to beat the initial surge to the train (Atlanta's 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73yKov40y7M" target="_blank">public transit</a> is always a gamble). Boarding the crowded MARTA car, the whole magic of the night sunk in: Midler wasn't just playing a witch—she was one. And a fucking awesome witch, at that.</p><p>

the 7,345 debates was an anxious exercise in just how much crazy the Republican
Party could take before it spinning off its axis. The answer was much more alarming—and
entertaining—than any of us could have imagined.
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	The 2016 Republican primary debates hold their own
promise. By my last count, <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/say-hello-to-the-newest-and-most-hopeless-gop-2016-candidates" target="_blank">there are approximately 1,200 men and women running
for the GOP nomination</a>; RealClearPolitics currently <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html" target="_blank">aggregates polling numbers</a>
	for 14 of those likely candidates, ostensibly the ones who might actually be
vaguely plausible options.
</p><!--recommended--><p>
	With so many candidates vying against each other,
the idea of a debate is daunting. Put them
all on a stage together and you basically just have a town hall of very rich
people. Leave some of them out, and you risk tainting the democratic process—and
bruising some very large egos. 
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	The solutions so far have been... interesting. Fox News
announced this week that its GOP primary debate—the first of the cycle—would 
	<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/fox-news-to-limit-the-field-for-first-gop-presidential-debate/2015/05/20/7d4e0386-ff2e-11e4-805c-c3f407e5a9e9_story.html?wpisrc=nl_readin&amp;wpmm=1" target="_blank">feature just the top ten candidates</a>, as determined by national polls, while the sad, jowly also-rans pace the media spin room and wonder why Ben Carson is up there talking about <em>their</em> flat tax plan.
</p><p>
	<em><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Related: <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/how-each-republican-will-kill-his-own-presidential-campaign-416" target="_blank">How Each Republican Candidate Will Kill His Own Presidential Campaign</a></strong><br>
	</em>
</p><p>
	If the debate were held today, according to Fox's criteria, it would include Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Mike
Huckabee, Ted Cruz, Carson, Chris Christie—<a href="http://www.vice.com/read/chris-christie-wants-an-apology-for-bridgegate-522" target="_blank">I know</a>, I'm surprised too—Rick
Perry, and Rick Santorum. Even without the other 1,190 other candidates, it's going to be a
crowded stage. It's hard to imagine most of these men ceding a microphone to
their wife at their wedding, let alone playing nice with nine other blowhards auditioning for the same job.
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	But wait, it gets better. CNN, which will 
	<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/20/politics/cnn-republican-candidates-debate/" target="_blank">host the second GOP debate at the Ronald Reagan Library in September</a>, will similarly limit the stage to the top 10 candidates. But they'll also host <em>another, </em>B-Team debate for any other candidate who's polling above 1 percent—which sounds like the most madcap development in US presidential politics since the days when the runner-up just got to be VP.
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	Of course, these new rules raise plenty of legitimate questions:
Why ten candidates and not six, or eight, or 12, or 100? How is this going to
work? Will Ted Cruz finally make another candidate cry? What will Wolf
Blitzer do then? What we do know is that speaking time will be short and the
spotlight hard to come by. So it would be wise for the candidates to start
shaping up their closing remarks early. I have some suggestions.

	A group of Brazilian doctors recently published a paper in the academic journal 
	<a href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/au/2014/768158/" target="_blank">Advances in Urology</a> identifying "woman-on-top" (aka cowgirl) as the most dangerous sex position in terms of the sheer number of dicks broken mid-fuck. Analyzing data from three accident and emergency units in the Brazilian city of Campinas over the past 13 years for clear cases of penile fractures (in which the ligament in the penis either tears or overextends, often with a loud, painful crack), the doctors determined that half of all such fractures came when women rode men, with 29 percent resulting from over-vigorous doggy-style and 21 percent resulting from missionary sex.
</p><!--recommended--><p dir="ltr">
	Those who made it trough the wince-inducing study may have tried to take comfort in the fact that sex-related injuries are rare. As it turns out, that's not entirely true. Urologists at the University of Washington Medical School alone say they see 
	<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-you-really-break-your/" target="_blank">at least one or two penile fractures a month</a>. More generally, a British study found that <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Sex/sex-related-injuries-common/story?id=10637541" target="_blank">up to five percent of the workforce</a> takes time off for expressly sex-related injuries every year. And although there's a great deal of under-reporting, self-treating, or misreporting of sex-related injuries, most estimates say that <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/7694575/Painful-passion-thousands-nursing-secret-sex-injuries.html" target="_blank">up to one-third of adults</a> will suffer some kind of injury during or directly from the dirty deed—<a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com.au/sex/sex-advice/2014/11/new-study-reveals-the-most-common-sex-injuries/" target="_blank">often without realizing the pain they're in until the morning after</a>, thanks to our lovely, sexed-up endorphins.

	Many of these injuries could happen outside of carnal embrace:
	<a href="http://graphs.net/injuries-that-occur-during-sex.html" target="_blank">carpet burns, pulled muscles, sprains, and the like</a>. But many more are fairly serious, associated with specific sexual scenarios, and utterly avoidable with the proper precautions.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	To save ourselves some grievous harm at the most unfortunate of times, VICE dove into the literature on sex-related injuries and spoke with renowned sex therapist 
	<a href="http://drkat.com/about/" target="_blank">Dr. Kat van Kirk</a> to create a list of the six most injurious heterosexual sexual positions and situations. (While there is overlap between heterosexual and homosexual sex injuries for both men and women, there are enough differences to merit their own future posts.)
</p><p dir="ltr">
	Our rankings were based on the severity of injuries involved and the frequency with which practitioners encounter them. We also identified the safest heterosexual sexual position, and a few very simple tips to help you avoid serious harm in any position to make sure sex doesn't wreck your bits.

</p><h3 dir="ltr">WOMAN-ON-TOP / COWGIRL</h3><p dir="ltr">
	The boys from Brazil were right about this one—
	<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/can-you-really-break-your/" target="_blank">it's fairly easy to hit things at the wrong angle</a> and get a snap-crackle-pop when a woman puts her full body weight down on a penis.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	"This issue is basically the woman's pubic bone," explains Dr. Van Kirk. "It's slightly differently positioned in each woman. At times there's not enough lubrication when the woman goes to sit on the penis if there's enough force or friction or the penis catches on the pubic bone, that's when that bend will occur in that ligament. That is more common than people think."
</p><p dir="ltr">
	FYI: Apparently, the angle involved in reverse cowgirl is even more dangerous than cowgirl.
</p><h3 dir="ltr">DOGGY STYLE AND ITS VARIANTS</h3><p dir="ltr">
	This one's mainly dangerous because forceful penetration at the wrong angle can, according to 
	<a href="http://www.beyondtherapyandwellness.com/#!about-btw/c1948" target="_blank">Dr. Kristi Latham</a>, a pelvic health specialist at Dallas's Beyond Therapy &amp; Wellness clinic, cause <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/health/7-hookup-injuries-that-are-more-common-than-you-110732212987.html" target="_blank">vaginal tearing</a> (which is least common in cowgirl thanks to the woman's greater power to control depth and motion). Additionally, according to Dr. Kat, <a href="https://www.lelo.com/blog/top-10-common-sex-injuries/" target="_blank">deep and vigorous thrusts in a short vaginal canal can cause cervical bruising</a> or even bleeding. But wait! There's more: issue associated with doggy.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	"I'll often see from rear-entry positions guys going to penetrate the vagina and fairly often the penis will accidentally go into the anus," says Dr. Kat. "And because there wasn't any preparation, there can be anal tears and things like that."
</p><h3 dir="ltr">[body_image width='1024' height='684' path='images/content-images/2015/05/22/' crop='images/content-images-crops/2015/05/22/' filename='yes-you-actually-can-shatter-your-dick-253-body-image-1432305510.jpg' id='58949']</h3><p dir="ltr" class="photo-credit">

	Oral sex is 
	<a href="http://www.skinsight.com/adult/conjunctivitisPinkEye.htm" target="_blank">a great fast pass to pink eye</a> if your partner isn't as hygienic as he or she could be, leading to the introduction of fecal matter onto the cornea. But two parties engaging in the practice simultaneously is double trouble when it comes to the sewage-face conundrum.
</p><h3 dir="ltr">TITTY FUCKING</h3><p dir="ltr">
	You'd never expect this one, but apparently men run into trouble when penis meets breast.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	"I've seen a few penile fractures, not just with the pelvic bone, but when guys are in the process of trying to give a pearl necklace," says Dr. Kat. "Sometimes they'll put so much force against the woman's sternum that it can fracture [the penis], and if you're not using any lube, the friction can cause some problems too."
</p><h3 dir="ltr">MISSIONARY</h3><p dir="ltr">
	Even the most seemingly boring, safe, and sacred position poses risks. According to Dr. Kat, while it's not as common as in rear-entry positions, it's pretty easy for women with short vaginal canals to suffer cervical bruising or other abrasions from deep thrusts.

</p><h3>POORLY LUBRICATED SEX</h3><p dir="ltr">
	"Regardless of position, one of the main things I see are vaginal and penile abrasions from not enough lubrication," says Dr. Kat. "If there's not enough lube and you're just trying to force things or if you're just jumping into it without a whole lot of lubrication or foreplay, it can cause nasty abrasions. I've seen those get infected pretty regularly."
</p><p dir="ltr">
	Unfortunately, just slathering on lube isn't good lubrication either, because so many people wind up having 
	<a href="http://www.edgeboston.com/health_fitness/health/news//41775/lubricants,_condoms_and_allergic_reactions" target="_blank">allergic reactions</a> to many over-the-counter gels (and condoms and sex toys) leading to further irritations.
</p><h3 dir="ltr">UNCHARACTERISTICALLY ACROBATIC SEX</h3><p dir="ltr">
	This one's simple: if you're 
	<a href="http://www.webmd.com/sex-relationships/features/better-shape-for-better-sex" target="_blank">out of shape</a> or doing something you're not used to, you just might hurt yourself. Lifting someone at the wrong angle or <a href="http://www.feelingprettyremarkable.com/blog/sex-injuries-tales-clinic" target="_blank">bending in the wrong way</a> can lead to pulled muscles at best and broken extremities and <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2011/03/22/occasional-sex-or-exercise-can-trigger-heart-attacks-%E2%80%94-so-do-it-more-often/" target="_blank">heart attacks</a> at worst, especially when you're <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/7694575/Painful-passion-thousands-nursing-secret-sex-injuries.html" target="_blank">getting down on iffy surfaces</a> like stairs or rickety tables.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	"People trying to do things in the shower or in their cars," says Dr. Kat, "there I see things like actual broken bones just from trying to do things that might be outside of their typical range."
</p><h3 dir="ltr">UNPRACTICED KINK SEX</h3><p dir="ltr">
	Although usually 
	<a href="http://www.thefrisky.com/2011-06-28/8-sex-injuries/" target="_blank">low-level injuries</a> are related to excessive spanking or hair pulling, at times people try whips and chains and other exciting things without reading up on how to properly use them. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/02/10/sex-toy-injuries-surged-after-fifty-shades-of-grey-was-published/ " target="_blank">This trend actually spiked during the release of the <em>50 Shades</em> books and movies</a>, and seems to be on the rise in general, probably thanks to the rise in awareness of kinky lifestyles in the media but not a concurrent rise in open, candid, and common conversations on safe kink sex practice.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	"I don't see it typically with people who have practiced it for a long time or at least with one partner who is well versed," says Dr. Kat. "But things that have been wrapped around the penis or limbs too long or too hard and causing bruising or contusions or things of that nature. Most of those practices, if they're done responsibly, are not very unsafe [though]."
</p><h3 dir="ltr">FORGETFUL SEX</h3><p dir="ltr">
	Whether in the anus or the vagina, men and women often forget that they've placed things inside of themselves, leading to lodged objects 
	<a href="http://blogs.webmd.com/womens-health/2012/05/oh-no-where-did-it-go-when-things-get-lost-in-the-vagina.html" target="_blank">only discovered much later</a>.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	"Lost condoms, lost tampons, lost sex toys, and sometimes other lost items that shouldn't be used for sex toys in the anus and vagina," says Dr. Kat. "Especially when people have been drinking or using some kind of substance, their judgment is off and their ability to sense and feel sensation might be altered in some way. I've seen it plenty of times: People won't even realize that something was stuck there. They either figure that the condom got thrown away or that the little vibrator was taken out at some point.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	Then they present because of other symptoms like infection symptoms, [like] itching and discharge. The cervix can become so inflamed that it bleeds. I've seen it more with men than with women [in the anus]. Retrieval requires emergency personnel because you have to employ ultrasounds or x-rays, because the anus can go up into the colon." Hope you have health insurance!

</p><h3 dir="ltr">UNCLEAN SEX</h3><p dir="ltr">
	The presence of fecal matter during sex can lead to 
	<a href="http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/understanding-bladder-infections-basic-information" target="_blank">the contamination of the urinary tract</a> for men and women (but more often and more acutely for women) leading to urinary tract infections. Cleanliness isn't just a matter of wandering fecal matter, though. More often than you'd think, <a href="http://www.punchng.com/entertainment/sex-sexuality/common-sex-related-injuries-and-their-cures-i/" target="_blank">spicy food on hands and lips</a> becomes an irritating issue during sex.
</p><h3 dir="ltr">STRESSED-OUT SEX</h3><p dir="ltr">
	As you might imagine, sex just isn't as enjoyable or relaxing when you're stressed out. But according to Dr. Latham, it can become physically painful as well due to the over-clenching of the pelvic floor, causing orgasms to feel more spasmodic and causing unpleasant sensations during penetration in women due to reduced flexibility.

</p><hr><h2 dir="ltr">A LESS DANGEROUS SEX POSITION FOR ALL!</h2><p dir="ltr">
	For those discouraged about their (heterosexual) sexual safety, take heart: there is one sexual position that seems, anecdotally and wholly unscientifically, safer than the rest.
</p><h3 dir="ltr">SIDE-TO-SIDE SEX / SPOONING SEX</h3><p dir="ltr">
	"Even probably better than missionary when it comes to sex is the side-by-side position," says Dr. Kat, "which is typically recommended to couples who are pregnant."
</p><p dir="ltr">
	"There's no real pressure on any specific joint. Insertion, even though it's typically through rear-entry and not through the front, usually has a little bit of buffer with the body so the penis won't hit the pelvic bone as quickly or bruise the cervix as often."
</p><p dir="ltr">
	But just because this position is inherently safer than most others, that doesn't mean that you should only spoon-fuck from here on out. Every position can be a safe position so long as a few very basic and fundamental precautions (and preconditions for good sex) are observed.
</p><p dir="ltr">
	"All [positions] are very safe if you're lubricated," says Dr. Kat, "if you're communicating, and if you're not trying to force things before somebody's ready."
</p><p dir="ltr">
	If you do wind up suffering some manner of injury, it's not the end of the world. Most can be treated with simple approaches like 
	<a href="http://www.fitnessrepublic.com/inspiration/lifestyle/6-common-sex-injuries-and-how-to-deal.html" target="_blank">icing, rest, or cranberry juice</a>. But for serious pain, just suck it up and visit a doctor. You don't want to fuck over your sex life permanently, do you?

	The "bloodthirsty media" Huckabee is referring to is

Duggar admitted that the first incident had occurred in 2002, when at age 14, he "fondl[ed] a minor's breasts while she slept." On Thursday, a judge in Arkansas ordered that the <a href="http://www.nwaonline.com/news/2015/may/22/judge-orders-josh-duggars-record-destroyed/?latest" target="_blank">2006 police report be expunged</a> from Duggar's record.

	On Thursday, Josh, now 27, 
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/duggarfamilyofficial/posts/653931128073873" target="_blank">issued an apology</a> on the official Duggar Facebook page. The post also included statements from the Duggar parents and Josh's wife Anna. Here's Josh's statement:

</p><p>
	Huckabee has been close with the Duggars for years. The family supported the former Arkansas governor during his 2008 presidential bid, and

<title>The Woman Who Went to Jail to Save Her Son from Circumcision Is Giving In</title>

</p><p>Heather Hironimus has been fighting for four years to make sure her son kept his foreskin, but after her arrest on charges of interfering with custody, it appears the battle is finally over—and she's giving in.</p><p>Hironimus had been locked in combat with her ex-boyfriend Dennis Nebus over a circumcision procedure she had agreed to permit before changing her mind. The legal machinations of this case endured well past the usual age for circumcisions, but neither parent would relent.
</p><!--recommended--><p>
	But, according to the 
	<a href="http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/news/heather-hironimus-signs-consent-for-sons-circumcision-6994105" target="_blank">New Times Broward-Palm Beach</a>, Hironimus received an ultimatum from Judge Jeffrey Gillen: Sign a form consenting to the procedure, or be stuck in jail for some indeterminate amount of time. She appeared in court on Friday and refused to sign, and was sent back to lockup.</p><p>But moments later, she decided to cave, and the court was reconvened. Hironimus cried as her lawyer held the document in place, and she struggled to use a pen while in handcuffs. In the end, the document was signed, and the foreskin's fate was sealed.</p><p>Intact America is an activist group that has been very vocal about this case. In an email to VICE, Georganne Chapin of Intact America referred to the situation as "beyond appalling." </p><p>
	According to the 
	<em><a href="http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/update-boynton-mom-agrees-to-let-son-be-circumcise/nmMHq/" target="_blank">Palm Beach Post</a>,</em> Hironimus has yet to be arraigned for interfering with her custody agreement, and a bail hearing for that charge not yet been scheduled.
</p><p>
	As we've 
	<a href="http://www.vice.com/read/a-lady-in-florida-is-in-jail-after-months-on-the-run-to-prevent-her-son-from-being-circumcised-103" target="_blank">previously mentioned</a>, multiple judges have ruled that the circumcision should take place, since Hironimus had formally capitulated to the father's wish that their son Chase be circumcised when she signed the initial custody agreement with Nebus.
</p><p>
	But 
	according to Nebus's attorney, May Cain, there have been "death threats," against Nebus, prompting him to consider taking the four-year-old out of state to have the procedure performed. According to <a href="http://www.local10.com/news/tearful-mother-consents-to-sons-circumcision-during-court-appearance/33170716" target="_blank">Local10.com</a>, the judge has authorized Nebus to take Chase out of state and unilaterally make all medical decisions on his behalf.
</p><p>But Chapin of Intact America told VICE that to do so would be "despicable." She explained that "no physician in the United States can consider Heather Hironimus's signature—obtained while she was in handcuffs, exhausted, and under threat of indefinite detention—to be valid."</p><p>
	The judge told the parents, "You are going to have to learn to deal with each other in a civil and amicable manner," according to the  
	<em>Palm Beach Post.</em>
</p><p>
	Protesters were gathered outside of the courthouse before Hironimus signed. In a video, one protester named Tara Shipley told the 
	<em>Palm Beach Post.</em> "We're standing beside Heather. We support Heather, and we hope she knows that she's not alone." She added, "The court has shown that they're really not thinking about the boy's best interest."</p><p><em>Follow Mike Pearl on <a href="http://twitter.com/mikeleepearl">Twitter</a>.</em></p>

frequently stated thesis in 
	<i>Tomorrowland</i>,
a relentlessly earnest bumper sticker of a film which argues our love for
the narrative of dystopia has become a self-fulfilling prophecy and that we've
lost our once keen cultural calling for exploration and innovation as a result.
It's a noble message, even a bold and necessary one, but one loses its potency
when the film goes about expressing it with a megaphone.

	Written by <i>Lost</i>
	scribe Damon Lindelof and the great Brad Bird (Bird also directed), 
	<i>Tomorrowland</i> follows a
teen of indeterminate age, Casey (Britt Robertson), who is first seen
sabotaging the disassembly of a Cape Canaveral NASA launch platform where her father works. "Why are they taking the platform down?" Casey's little brother asks
her one night. "Because it's hard to have ideas," she responds. "And easy to
give up." Frustratingly, this is not the only exchange in the film that feels
cribbed from the self-help aisle.

	Casey comes upon a pin with the apparent ability to
transport her to a secret world created by elites in both the arts and the
sciences—a world beyond the graying, desaturated colors of her chronically
uncurious Earth. At this point, 
	<i>Tomorrowland</i>
	finally feels as though it is about to spring to wondrous life, like a blockbuster answer to the full-color reveal in Tarkovsky's
1979 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM_GOpfEQUw" target="_blank">dystopian classic</a> <i>Stalker</i><i></i>, but
here with gravity defying multi-layer pools and jetpacks with built-in crash
cushions pushing A-grade futurist imagination candy. However, Casey's trip ends
abruptly when the pin loses energy, leading her to join forces with the
curmudgeonly old inventor,Frank (George Clooney, segueing comfortably into the
winningly groggy grumpiness of late-period Harrison Ford) who was once a
fixture in Tomorrowland before being mysteriously excommunicated.

</p><p>
	And that's pretty much it. For a film that's gotten the full
mystery box marketing anti-blitz, there's not a whole lot hidden for reveal
here. While our initial glimpses of Tomorrowland are intoxicating—thanks in no
small part to the crisp work of cinematographer Claudio Miranda, production
designer Scott Chambliss, and composer Michael Giacchino—almost all of the
ensuing film is about the not-particularly-urgent race to return, resulting in
the cinematic equivalent of that

	</i> cartoon from <i data-redactor-tag="i">The
Simpsons
	</i> with the elusive fireworks factory. In that episode, Itchy and
Scratchy pass a series of billboard promising the increasing proximity of a
fireworks factory—an ideal venue for cartoon destruction. But instead of the fireworks factory we get Poochie, leaving Springfield's
favorite loser Milhouse to 
	<a href="http://imgur.com/r/TheSimpsons/OIQJ7" target="_blank">wail in disappointment</a>. In the elongated, feature-length act one that is <i>Tomorrowland</i>, we are all Milhouse.

	Yet for all of the failings of <i>Tomorrowland</i>, almost all of them are noble ones. There's a
lionization of braininess in the film that's genuinely inspiring and lends the movie its affecting final image. And while most summer tentpole films, good or
bad, seem to rush through the talking in a race to the pyrotechnics. 
	<i>Tomorrowland</i> goes full stream in the
opposite direction.
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	Aside from a midpoint raid on Frank's home, staged with
Bird's signature sugar-rush sense of giddiness, most of the action beats feel
obligatory, as though Lindelof and Bird were on a warpath towards their true
object of desire: constant, nudging, laborious affirmations about the necessity
of optimism. I have no doubt that the team behind 
	<i>Tomorrowland</i> is earnest in their intentions—the film bares not the
stink of a committee-sanctioned hack-job, but rather the heated fervor of a
passion project gone awry.

Photo courtesy of Disney</p><p>This makes a good deal of sense. Bird, an auteur of the
whiz-bang variety, and a frequently brilliant one at that, has always expressed
an inclination towards humanistic good vibes in the face of unimaginable
destruction, whether those stem from the tensions of the atomic age (<i>The Iron Giant</i>) or the potential for
comic-book annihilation (<i>The Incredibles</i>).
He's a gifted storyteller, armed not only with tremendous imagination, but
great generosity as well—an empathetic impulse that finds the same allure and
beating heart in the delicately seared salmon plates of 
	<i>Ratatouille</i> as it does in the endlessly cool gadgetry of his <i>Mission Impossible</i> entry. And of course,
nearly all of his films have demonstrated an appreciation for the popping
colors and shiny surfaces of 60s futurism—making this film a seeming confluence
of aesthetic and tonal concerns that you would think spells out a slam dunk.</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	Nevertheless, the unwieldiness of <i>Tomorrowland</i> gets the better of Bird. His earlier films managed to
articulate similar sentiments about the importance of visionary thinking, the
dangers of cynicism, the value of iconoclasts, and the necessity of goodness.
Here, the movie plays like the themes came first and everything else was an
afterthought. The text swallows the subtext whole, and then monologues about
it. The effect is exhausting.</p><hr><p><strong><em data-redactor-tag="em">Want to learn more about secret worlds?

	It's all the more interesting that <i>Tomorrowland</i> never quite gets it together, considering its
placement on the summer-movie calendar. Our multiplexes continue to assault us with
visions of impending doom and death.

</p><p>
	In between 1980's 
	<em>Autoamerican</em> and 1982's <em>The Hunter</em>, Chris Stein and Debbie Harry took time off from Blondie to
create Debbie Harry's first solo album. Although a record made by Blondie's
singer and main songwriter might seem like just another Blondie record, they
managed to differentiate it in a couple of ways. First off, the music
is more jazzy and no wave-y than most of Blondie's output. Debbie Harry dyed her
trademark blonde hair black. And the cover art, which for Blondie always featured a
photo of the male band members flanking Harry, is replaced with a shocking black-and-white painted portrait of Debbie Harry's head with giant needles piercing
through it.
</p><p class="normal">Many is the time I've come across the nearly life-sized head of Debbie Harry pierced with those metal prongs while flipping through old albums at a record store and been shocked. H. R. Giger, the Swiss artist best
known for designing the creatures in 
	<em>Alien</em>, was the artist responsible for the image, and he collaborated with Harry and Stein on a couple of music videos
as well.

	<b>VICE: How did you meet Giger?<br>
	</b><b data-redactor-tag="b">Chris
Stein: 
	</b>We were really lucky to hook up with him.
We were living on 58th Street and one of the galleries on 57th street had a
show of the stuff from 
	<em>Alien</em>. We happened to be there as he was coming back
from LA with his Oscar. He knew who we were and we brought him back to our
apartment. And that was it. From then on we were buddies.
</p><p class="normal">
	<b data-redactor-tag="b">Had you seen 
	<em>Alien</em> before meeting him?<br>
	</b>Yes, it was a big deal. It's amazing, still.
</p><p class="normal">
	<b data-redactor-tag="b">
	What did you talk about when you first met?<br>
	</b>I don't know, just stuff. Giger is like a
magician. Giger was like Alan Moore. There's a whole long line of magician
artists like Jodorowsky, Alan Moore, Austin Spare... You know Austin Spare? Great
British artist. Crowley, Vali Myers, Rosaleen Norton, and Freda Harris. They're
all people who were really into magic and were also artists. It's all about the
transcendence of the art and the art as a tool that one deals with their inner
workings. It's more than just creating an object. There's a certain connectivity.
I don't know if Pollock or people like him were definitely 
	<em>not</em> magicians, but it
didn't seem like a conscious effort on his part. In music, when we're doing
shows, it always feels like there's a tribal, primitive aspect to the whole
thing.

</p><p>
	<b></b><b data-redactor-tag="b">Are
you big into comics? 
	<br>
	</b>I just grew up with that stuff when I was
a kid. It was always there. Also, 
	<em>Famous Monsters</em> [<em>of Filmland</em>] was a big influence on
everyone in my generation. The fan thing is so broad now, but at the time it was
this little niche community. You know 
	<em>Famous Monsters of Filmland</em>?
</p><p class="normal">
	<b data-redactor-tag="b">Yes,
my friend Matt visited Forrest J. Ackerman's apartment before he died. Did you
know you immediately wanted to work with Giger upon meeting him?
	<br>
	</b>No, it took a year or two and then, when
we did that solo project with Debbie, we asked him to do the cover. We knew he'd
done a lot of covers prior to that. It was great. We stayed with him for like
two weeks in his house in Zurich.

</p><p class="normal">
	<b data-redactor-tag="b">What
was his home like?
	<br>
	</b>It was what you'd expect. It was two
townhouses that he'd knocked together on this little street. It was a very
normal, bucolic neighborhood. He had a life-size Alien standing up in one of his
spaces and he told us how he would wake up in the middle of the night and he would
forget it was there and it would scare the shit out of him.
</p><p class="normal">
	<b data-redactor-tag="b">Did
you work all day long while you were there?
	<br>
	</b>Yeah, he made a bunch of props that
surrounded the videos and he had some preexisting pieces in it. He had these
murals that were photographic prints of his smaller pieces but blown up, which
we used for backdrops. He did a casting of Debbie's face. She gets
claustrophobic and she couldn't stand the casting so they had to do one half of
her face at a time. We made a mummy case with Debbie's face on it. You can see
it in the video. His videos are out in the world.
</p><p class="pullquote">
	'All the art that's popular now will connect to Giger at some point. He's so intellectual and he's influenced a couple generations of artists. I don't know why he's neglected in the arts world.'
</p><p class="normal">
	<b data-redactor-tag="b">How
do you feel about the videos he made?
	<br>
	</b>They're OK. I wish they'd been shot a
little more hi-def. I don't know if they're 16mm or Super8. I don't know how
much they could be tweaked.

</p><p class="normal">
	<b data-redactor-tag="b">
	Did you discuss the stories behind the videos?<br>
	</b>I guess? The <em>KooKoo</em> album title came
from him because of acupuncture. The "koo" came from the 
	<em>koo</em> in
	<em>acupuncture</em>. So he was referring to that. He thought it was the ultimate punk
thing even though it's kind of sci-fi. The cover contrasts with the record, which
is sort of R&amp;B. It kind of works.
</p><p class="normal">
	<b data-redactor-tag="b">The
cover is so different from all the Blondie stuff.
	<br>
	</b>They banned it from the British public
transport. They made a safe-for-work version with a triangle so you couldn't
see the needles, which seems crazy to me in retrospect.
</p><p class="normal">
	<b data-redactor-tag="b">What's
the significance of the needles going through Debbie's face? Just shock imagery?
	<br>
	</b>I think he was thinking about punk. He may have done some sketches with safety
pins. He has used safety pins in his drawings.
</p><p class="has-image">
	[body_image width='1000' height='1337' path='images/content-images/2015/05/22/' crop='images/content-images-crops/2015/05/22/' filename='blondies-chris-stein-recalls-working-with-hr-giger-309-body-image-1432301696.jpg' id='58914']
</p><p class="normal">
	<b data-redactor-tag="b">How
do you feel about how the art relates to the music?
	<br>
	</b>It's a little incongruous, but I think
it's fallen into place. People accept it. The imagery is sorta sci-fi, while the
music was urban. It's up to everyone to interpret it as they will.
</p><p class="normal">
	<b data-redactor-tag="b">Have
you worked with many artists before or since?
	<br>
	</b>Yeah, we just worked with <a href="http://www.jhwilliams3.com" target="_blank">J. H. Willams III</a>
	who does <em>Batwoman</em>. He just did the last cover. I'd love to do more stuff with
him.
</p><p class="normal">
	<b data-redactor-tag="b">
	Did you art-direct the previous Blondie records?<br>
	</b>To a small extent. With the <em>Autoamerican</em> cover, I saw an image of a model on that same roof and I asked him to
do the same painting, but with us on the roof. Jimmy Destri, our keyboard player,
did the logo for 
	<em>Eat to the Beat</em>. He has good graphic skills. <em>The Hunter</em> record
cover really fucked over the record. These guys came to us when we were working
on 
	<em>The Hunter</em> and they had this really cool image of a girl from the waist down
in high heels and a tight skirt holding a cheetah on a leash. It was this
gritty black-and-white image and they asked us if we wanted to use it for the
cover and we should have fucking used it! I had forgotten about it and then I
was reading my old archived blogs and I had written about it. The cover really
fucked that record. The idea of the cover was supposed to be that we'd get Rick
Baker or somebody and get half-human, half-animal makeup. This was long before
	<em>Cats: The Musical</em>, or any of that crap.
</p><p class="normal">
	<b data-redactor-tag="b">I
always wondered what was up with that cover...
	<br>
	</b>Yeah, it's just shitty. I'm sure the record
company talked us out of using the girl with the cheetah on the leash.
</p><p class="normal">
	[<em data-redactor-tag="em">At this point Chris's wife started
reciting dialogue from 
	</em>Spinal Tap.<em data-redactor-tag="em"> "What's wrong with being sexy? You've got a
woman on all fours with a glove being shoved in her face!"</em>]
</p><p class="normal">
	[<em>Laughs</em>] So they wanted a picture of
Debbie on the cover, of course, so that's where that went. 
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="has-image">

</p><p class="normal">
	<b data-redactor-tag="b">After
working with Giger on the album art, did you continue a relationship with him?
	<br>
	</b>Yeah, we stayed friends. I have a throne
he designed. It's one of a very few in the country. The seat cushion rotted
completely at one point and he gave me a second seat cushion, which is starting
to rot. It was made from foam rubber.
</p><p class="normal">
	The last time we saw him it was at his house, a few years before he died. He
was still active and vigorous. But then I started hearing from Les, his manager,
that he was declining. It's a shame. My big problem is that he doesn't have a
piece in the Modern. It seems crazy. All the art that's popular now will
connect to Giger at some point. They're derisive of his Hollywood connection.
He's so intellectual and he's influenced a couple generations of artists. I
don't know why he's neglected in the arts world.
</p><p class="normal">
	<b data-redactor-tag="b">Is
there anything else you'd like to say about Giger?
	<br>
	</b>He's a really sweet guy.

	<a href="http://www.brainwashed.com/kid606/home.html" target="_blank">Kid606</a>, whose real name is Miguel Trost De Pedro, has been making electronic music since 1998. The work of his that I'm most familiar with is his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K87rsQRid6k" target="_blank">really intense IDM</a>, which draws from his devout love of industrial, noise, and death metal. You won't be getting any harshness this time around, though. To paint a picture of the type of music Kid606 is making these days, he recently covered Brian Eno's<em> Discreet Music</em> in its entirety. Lately, he's been creating introspective, drony, ambient songs, rather than the dance-crazy MDMA-powered hardcore beats of his past, and they sound beautiful. </p><p>He's got a new album out called<em>Recollected Ambient Works Vol. 1: Bored of Excitement. </em>Above is a music video for one of the album's standout tracks, "B Minor," which pairs Kid606's music with geometrical animation created by <a href="https://vimeo.com/jeanettebonds">Jeanette Bonds</a>, a talented young artist who recently graduated CalArts.</p><p><em>Buy Kid606's new album <a href="https://midheaven.com/item/recollected-ambient-works-vol-1-bored-of-excitement-by-kid-606-cd#.VV8zTJNVikp">here</a>.</em><br></p>

<title>Humanity, Police Violence, and Being Black on the Internet</title>

</p><p>
	Awareness of <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/eric-garner-and-the-plague-of-police-brutality-against-black-menhttp://www.vice.com/read/eric-garner-and-the-plague-of-police-brutality-against-black-men" target="_blank">violence against black bodies</a> by the hands of the civil servants charged with our protection has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/magazine/our-demand-is-simple-stop-killing-us.html" target="_blank">reached critical mass on the internet</a>. It feels like every few days another black man, woman, or child is replaced by a hashtag. And while it is draining to traverse from anger to sadness to resignation and back on a weekly basis, it's important that I don't completely look away. I can't ignore what's happening to us. And I can't afford to forget that this crisis of violence isn't an abstraction, but something that has real, personal, human costs. These people are not merely symbols or martyrs. The families and friends left behind aren't just subjects of heartbreaking photography. I try to think about them as individuals. I think of Mike Brown, Rekia Boyd, Freddie Gray, Akai Gurley, and Eric Garner. </p><p>And I fear for who we might lose next.
</p><p>
	News on Twitter is all about speed, and word of these killings and the subsequent protests and reactions is no different thanks to the work of activists like <a href="https://twitter.com/deray" target="_blank">DeRay McKesson</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/Nettaaaaaaaa" target="_blank">Johnetta Elzie</a>, and many others. Twitter has been invaluable for following these tragedies, but also for following how traditional media regards us and how the state itself tries to <a href="https://twitter.com/BaltimorePolice/status/593242222096719874" target="_blank">shape</a> the <a href="https://twitter.com/jonswaine/status/593244434210390017" target="_blank">narrative</a> of what and who we are.
</p><!--recommended--><p>
	But it's not just about receiving the news. When you live your life around people for whom news of these events doesn't seem to register—much less resonate—we go online to express our personal and communal grief. And while this is important for black people online in particular, I feel it's important that everyone sees us—that they see how much hurt and anger these tragedies cause us, to dispel the idea that just because we live, we're removed.</p><p>
	And while it may not seem important how "others" see "us," this visibility is crucial. We can talk about racism, we can talk about <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/who-wins-when-cops-wear-cameras-908" target="_blank">body cameras</a>, and we can talk about the failures of our justice system—and we should. We can talk about the neglect and political dysfunction that's ignored in our communities until there's something <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/29/us/baltimore-mother-slapping-son/" target="_blank">salacious and voyeuristic</a> to look at. But a fundamental problem that endures is that we can't look past blackness and see humanity. We can't look past blackness and see just a person.
</p><p>
	And while I believe that "ignorance is the burden of the ignorant," as Ta-Nehisi Coates <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2009/12/there-are-no-poor-white-people/32500/" target="_blank">once wrote</a>, I also believe that the window Twitter provides into the diversity and complexity of black people is an effective teacher. It's easy to generalize, to create a broad understanding or lens through which to view people who are different from us. It's easy to understand the things you've spent time and effort getting to know and stop there. And it's not always easy to access black thought and emotion if you don't have that readily around you in a physical space. </p><p>Twitter changes that. If you truly want to know, we're out here. It's nobody's job to educate you, but no one is stopping you from listening.
</p><p><em><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">On VICE News: </strong></em><a href="https://news.vice.com/article/grand-jury-indicts-six-baltimore-officers-involved-in-freddie-grays-death" target="_blank"><em><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Grand Jury Indicts Six Baltimore Officers Involved in Freddie Gray's Death</strong></em></a></p><a href="https://news.vice.com/article/grand-jury-indicts-six-baltimore-officers-involved-in-freddie-grays-death" target="_blank"></a><p>
	Blacks make up about <a href="http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/00000.html" target="_blank">13 percent</a> of the population in the United States and just <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304419104579323442346646168" target="_blank">10 percent</a> of the country's internet denizens, yet comprise some 18 percent of Twitter users. This overrepresentation makes Twitter a space where, perhaps, black voices are louder and better heard (if not better understood). It also contrasts with the physical spaces that many white Twitter users live in. Twitter is where you can find something other than the binary representations of middle-class Cosby kid or crack dealer. There are real people behind these accounts living varied lives and experiences, and talking about them in real time. And while it's easy to view or use Twitter as a layer to create separation, you can't help but see how human people are as you watch them grapple with the world we live in.
</p><p>
	Still, the visibility provided by online spaces <a href="http://www.psmag.com/health-and-behavior/women-arent-welcome-internet-72170" target="_blank">isn't all goodness and light</a>, as we <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/05/internet-fails-to-be-nice-to-visiting-president.html" target="_blank">all—even President Obama—know</a>. When we open ourselves up, the exposure produces many negative results. There's the personal cost of making your allegiances and sympathies known. Strangers will attack you. There's the communal cost, such as when people feel emboldened to twist the #BlackLivesMatter movement into #AllLivesMatter, sometimes with <a href="http://www.amherstmedia.org/content/reactions-black-lives-matter-graffiti-mural-covered-all-lives-umass-amherst" target="_blank">ugly real-life results</a>, like at UMass-Amherst recently. Here we have an eerie convergence of what happens to black people in both physical and online spaces: We're either set apart when it's convenient, or swallowed up under the flag of inclusion that flies primarily for those already included.
</p><p>
	But the costs are worth paying if it means that the dignity and worth of black people will be more broadly recognized. It'll be worth it when testimony that we are <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/the-ferguson-grand-jury-has-finally-reached-a-decision-1124" target="_blank">literal monsters</a> is no longer credible and that being less than an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/25/us/michael-brown-spent-last-weeks-grappling-with-lifes-mysteries.html" target="_blank">"angel"</a> doesn't factor into whether we live or die. And while we just want to be seen as human beings, it's important to note that police officers, prosecutors, judges and jury members are just humans, too. And if they can't recognize the humanity in us that they take for granted in themselves, as they plead for understanding of their fears and their actions when these killings happen, how can they be expected to truly serve and protect us?
</p><p>
	Technologies like Twitter have made the world a smaller place, certainly, yet that endeavor shouldn't begin and end with the closing of physical distance, but rather with the extension of humanity and understanding to a wider group of humans.

That man, the woman said, had just lifted up Melissa's skirt and taken pictures.
</p><p>
	The police haven't caught the 
	<a href="https://news.vice.com/article/upskirt-photos-and-revenge-porn-share-barely-legal-gray-area" target="_blank">upskirt photographer</a>, though Melissa <a href="https://helplessinfulton.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">started a website</a> to chronicle her experience following the crime and said she will post an update should he be caught. But while New York has a history of <a href="http://nypost.com/2014/01/15/doctor-admits-using-upskirt-pen-cam-to-avoid-jail/" target="_blank">punishing those caught taking upskirt pictures</a>, plenty of states do not.
</p><p>
	Take Oregon, where a 13-year-old girl was approached in Target by 61-year-old Patrick Buono. Buono crouched next to the girl and stealthily snapped photos up her skirt. The minor didn't notice, but another shopper did. Buono was arrested. But when he appeared in court in February, <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/beaverton/index.ssf/2015/02/taking_photos_up_girls_skirt_a.html" target="_blank">he was acquitted on all charges</a>.
</p><p>
	While the judge presiding over Buono's case found the act to be "lewd" and "appalling," he said that unfortunately, as Oregon law is written, nothing actually prohibits what happened in that Target store.
</p><p>
	Similarly, two different Texas courts <a href="https://news.vice.com/article/court-ruling-makes-taking-pictures-up-womens-skirts-legal-in-texas" target="_blank">threw out a law targeting improper photography</a>, an umbrella term that covered upskirt and other photos meant to provide sexual gratification, leaving no law to address upskirts in the state since last year.
<!--recommended-->
</p><p>
	<a href="http://hollykearl.com/" target="_blank">Holly Kearl</a>, an adjunct professor of women's studies at George Mason University in Virginia and author of two books about sexual harassment, said that many state laws haven't caught up with technology, and that it often takes someone being acquitted for a crime before politicians are even aware laws aren't adequate.
</p><p>
	"One of the biggest weakness with many voyeurism laws is that they don't include public spaces as places that people have the right to privacy," she said. "Places like locker rooms or bathrooms are protected, but places like subways and parks often aren't."
</p><p>
	Kearl, who also founded the nonprofit organization Stop Street Harassment, compiled a 
	<a href="http://www.stopstreetharassment.org/strategies/sshlaw/" target="_blank">list of state laws addressing all forms of sexual harassment</a> in 2013. She found that not all police departments have kept up with advances in technology, which she said could impact efforts to address crimes like upskirt photography.
</p><p>
	"There is a big range in how technologically advanced departments were," Kearl said. "That comes into play."
</p><p>
	And while Congress passed the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/108/s1301" target="_blank">Video Voyeurism Protection Act of 2004</a>, that law only applies to federally owned property, places where a small percentage of the population actually spends time.</p><p class="pullquote">"It's not a crime for photographers to take pictures of what's publicly visible in public places and then distribute those photographs." –Eugene Volokh</p><p>
	For all the holes in some state laws, many do have legislation in place to prosecute those who take upskirts and similar photography, <a href="http://www.islandgazette.net/news-server9/index.php/news/local-news1/item/1774-man-found-guilty-of-possessing-pictures-taken-up-minors-dress" target="_blank">such as North Carolina</a>, where a man was recently sentenced to three years probation for taking photos up girls' dresses at church.
</p><p>
	But many such photos and videos don't stay on the devices that capture them; they are instead put online, where women who are unaware they have been photographed—and haven't given consent for the use their images—drive web traffic and revenue through advertising and membership fees.

</p><hr><p>
	A quick Google search will show that there is no shortage of voyeuristic content online, be it illegal upskirt photos or images of women in public (what is commonly referred to as a "creepshot"). And as LAPD Commander Andrew Smith explained, the latter, in most cases, is perfectly legal.
</p><p>
	Smith said that when in public, people may record others with or without consent, a point reaffirmed by Eugene Volokh, the Gary T. Schwartz Professor of Law at University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), who has written extensively on First Amendment issues, including the right to take photographs.
</p><p>
	 "It's not a crime for photographers to take pictures of what's publicly visible in public places and then distribute those photographs," he said.
</p><p>
	Websites that host such content are not usually breaking any laws, according to Volokh, and women who would find themselves on such websites often have little recourse.</p><p>Should a woman see herself 
	<a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/when-making-fun-of-tinder-creeps-gets-your-photos-on-a-revenge-porn-site" target="_blank">being upskirted or recorded using hidden cameras</a>, she <em>could</em> contact law enforcement and ask them to investigate. But as Volokh explained, that wouldn't be easy; federal law  makes most websites immune from facing charges related to content uploaded by its users.</p><p>
	"If internet service providers and website operators were held liable for what their users posted, they wouldn't allow users to post things or would take them down whenever there's threatened litigation," he said, suggesting that the law enables greater exchange of ideas and communications online.
</p><p>
	The best case scenario from a victim's standpoint would be law enforcement subpoenaing the service provider to track down the poster, and from there finding and prosecuting the photographer. </p><p>Further complicating the issue, many websites are hosted in other countries, so pursuing charges or lawsuits would require either extradition or the cooperation of a foreign nation, both of which can be rather tricky.</p><p>
	"People are prosecuted for things they post online, it's just not easy to do," Volokh said.
</p><p>It is possible that websites making advertising and membership revenue could be sued for violating a woman's right of publicity, which is generally understood as the right to stop someone else from using any aspect of your identity in merchandising or advertising, Volokh said.</p><p><strong><em data-redactor-tag="em"><a href="https://news.vice.com/article/upskirt-photos-and-revenge-porn-share-barely-legal-gray-area" target="_blank">Related: VICE News reports on another legal gray area—revenge porn.</a></em></strong></p><p>
	Though many websites subsist in legal gray zones, some large sites have taken it upon themselves to self-censor user posts, according to Soraya Chemaly, the executive director of the Women's Media Center Speech Project and a women's rights advocate.
</p><p>
	She pointed to changes Facebook has made, such as choosing to take down pages with names like "<a href="https://www.change.org/p/please-sign-to-remove-12-year-old-slut-meme-s-facebook" target="_blank">12 Year Old Slut Memes</a>"—which featured photos of young girls with explicit and crude captions—as well as Reddit's removal of its 
	<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/creepshots" target="_blank">creepshot subreddit</a> as progress. (It's worth nothing that a subreddit that <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/CandidFashionPolice/" target="_blank">claims to be a critique of fashion hosts content</a> that is at least a little similar to the stuff on the old creepshot page.)</p><p>
	"Non-consensual photography is a big deal, and we need to make sure that companies appreciate how big a deal it is to us in terms of victim advocacy," said Chemaly, who organized the Safety and Free Speech Coalition, which works to end online harassment in various forms. "There is a greater appreciation for the harm that can be done by non-consensual photography."<br></p><p class="has-image">[body_image width='897' height='472' path='images/content-images/2015/05/21/' crop='images/content-images-crops/2015/05/21/' filename='its-still-not-a-crime-to-take-photos-up-someones-skirt-521-body-image-1432170437.png' id='58282'] </p><p class="photo-credit">Screenshot from reddit.com/r/upskirt</p><p>
	As non-government organizations address the proliferation of voyeuristic content online, many states have begun to change laws to ensure actions like upskirt photography are in fact illegal. In Texas, <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/84R/analysis/html/SB01317I.htm" target="_blank">Senate Bill 1317</a>, which would address the issues in the law that got struck down, has been passed by the State Senate and awaits approval from the House, according to Texas State Senator Jose Menendez, the San Antonio Democrat who authored the bill.
</p><p>
	 "It wasn't too long ago when most people weren't walking around with smartphones that have high definition cameras," Menendez said.  "People have certain expectations of privacy that should be normal... we have to use technology in the best ways to both protect and serve our communities."
</p><p>
	In Massachusetts, legislators hastily <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/07/justice/massachusetts-upskirt-bill/" target="_blank">passed a bill outlawing upskirt photography</a> last year after a judge on the State Supreme Judicial Court ruled there was no such law in effect. And Kearl said that through her capacity working with the OpEd Project, which aims to increase underrepresented populations in commentary forums such as editorial pieces in newspapers, legislators have reached out to her and asked what might be done to improve their own states' voyeurism laws.
</p><p>
	Other organizations, such as the 
	<a href="http://www.cybercivilrights.org/" target="_blank">Cyber Civil Rights Initiative</a>, aim to help women who have been victimized by illegal voyeuristic photography and other online harassment, like revenge porn.
</p><p>
	Kearl said that while laws concerning voyeuristic photography become stronger, most would benefit from additional punishments for those who upload those images to the internet, something few laws currently address. And, as depressing as it might sound, we might not see any improvements to the law until more high-profile cases make upskirt photography impossible to ignore.</p><p>
	"This isn't so common that it's happening to someone every day," Kearl said. "Until it is more prevalent, it might not gain traction or become a priority."

<title>Chris Christie Wants America to Apologize to Him for Bridgegate</title>
<link>http://www.vice.com/read/chris-christie-wants-an-apology-for-bridgegate-522</link>
<pubDate>Fri, 22 May 2015 19:45:00 +0000</pubDate>
<description><![CDATA[<p>For four days in September of 2013, two out of three access lanes closed down at the George Washington Bridge toll plaza in Fort Lee, New Jersey, gnarling traffic in the sleepy bedroom suburb. It held up emergency vehicles, stalled school buses—by the time the lanes reopened, furious tristate commuters had lost a combined 2,800 vehicle hours each day.</p><p>At the time, public officials in New Jersey dismissed the lane closings as a traffic study. As we all know now, it was actually a plot hatched by officials in Governor Chris Christie's administration to exact political revenge on the mayor of Fort Lee, a Democrat who had declined to endorse the governor's reelection campaign.</p><p>Earlier this month, two former state officials—Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, and Bill Baroni, the governor's top Port Authority appointee—were indicted on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/02/nyregion/us-indictment-details-plotting-in-new-jersey-bridge-scandal.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=N.Y.%20%2F%20Region&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article" target="_blank">federal fraud charges</a> in the bridge closure scandal; a third, former Port Authority official David Wildstein, pled guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and conspiracy.</p><p>All three argue that that they weren't the only ones involved in the lane closures—that key members of Christie's office definitely knew what was up in those early days of September 2013, including, perhaps, the governor himself, a man who, at the time, was fashioning himself as the savior of the Republican Party.</p><p>But the question of just who knew what and when could remain unanswered for a while longer. Announcing the charges, the US Attorney for New Jersey acknowledged that there were other, unnamed co-conspirators mentioned in the indictments, but has said that he doesn't expect anyone else will be charged. But on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/21/nyregion/prosecutors-in-george-washington-bridge-case-seek-to-seal-evidence.html?ref=nyregion&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">Tuesday</a>, prosecutors filed a motion to seal the evidence until the trial begins, claiming that they want to protect other public officials from "intense media scrutiny."</p><p>Lawyers for Kelly and Baroni have objected, saying that evidence is their best shot at vindication—in other words, that it will show they weren't the only ones behind the Bridgegate shitstorm. Wildstein's lawyer has also argued that "evidence exists" implicating Christie's involvement—but what that evidence might be is not yet known, and, if the seal is approved by the judge, we may not find out for another six months—just enough time for Christie to launch his long-anticipated presidential campaign.</p><p>Christie, meanwhile, is already taking his victory lap. Since loudly proclaiming his innocence at a nearly <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/transcript-chris-christies-news-conference-on-george-washington-bridge-scandal/2014/01/09/d0f4711c-7944-11e3-8963-b4b654bcc9b2_story.html" target="_blank">two-hour</a> press conference last January, he has maintained that he knew nothing about the lane closures. As the Bridgegate scandal has unfolded, the governor's political persona has oscillated wildly, from distressed—a portlier Nixon, before the Watergate levees broke—to triumphant barnstormer, confident he'll outlast the naysayers. But after the indictments were announced, he <a href="http://www.app.com/story/news/investigations/watchdog/investigations/2015/05/01/gov-chris-christie-silent-indictments-guilty-plea/26713879/" target="_blank">took to Twitter</a> to once again deny his involvement, casting himself as both the victim and the hero of the whole sordid scheme.</p><p><a href="https://www.vice.com/read/republicans-have-finally-turned-on-chris-christie-508" target="_blank"><strong><em data-redactor-tag="em">Related: Republicans Have Finally Turned on Chris Christie</em></strong></a></p><p>He took this Bridgegate martyrdom one step further Thursday, <a href="http://www.app.com/story/news/politics/new-jersey/chris-christie/2015/05/21/chris-christie-bridgegate-coverage-cnbc/27717727/" target="_blank">appearing</a> on CNBC's "Squawk Box" to attack what he sees as a liberal bias in the media's coverage of the scandal. He even went so far as to demand an apology from reporters who have questioned his involvement.</p><p>"I do believe there is an absolute bias and a rush to judgment. You all know this. You saw the coverage of me 15 months ago. I was guilty, guilty. I had done it," Christie said. "Now we're 15 months later, where are the apologies pouring in [now] that not one thing I said on the day after the bridge situation has been proven to be wrong?"</p><p>Of course, Christie's own brand of Bridgegate logic is completely detached from <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/republicans-have-finally-turned-on-chris-christie-508" target="_blank">actual public perception of him and his adminstration</a>. According to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/02/nyregion/charges-in-bridge-scandal-pose-trouble-for-chris-christie.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=N.Y.%20%2F%20Region&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article" target="_blank">interviews</a> with the <em>New York Times</em>, his closest acquaintances have all but dismissed the notion that the New Jersey governor has a chance with voters after the Bridgegate mess. Even his own state is sending a clear message: In <a href="http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news-and-events/quinnipiac-university-poll/new-jersey/release-detail?ReleaseID=2219" target="_blank">a recent Quinnipiac poll</a>, 65 percent of New Jersey residents said their governor wasn't fit to run the country.</p><p>The harshest words towards the governor came from a <em>Newark Star-Ledger</em><a href="http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/05/gov_christie_loses_his_marbles_on_national_tv_edit.html" target="_blank">op-ed</a> this week, after Christie went on Fox News to defend his low polling as a sign that his people want him to stay in office in New Jersey, not on Pennsylvania Avenue. In the piece, entitled, "Gov. Christie loses his marbles on national TV," the paper said the governor was "out of touch with reality" in thinking that he can actually make a credible run for president.</p><p>"It's no wonder that New Jersey is screaming a warning to the rest of the country," the paper wrote. "God forbid he gets a chance to make an even bigger mess on a larger stage."</p><p>None of this seems to have <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/chris-christies-2016-campaign-is-going-terribly-but-chris-christie-doesnt-give-a-fuck" target="_blank">deterred the governor from charging ahead with his planned 2016 campaign</a>. In recent weeks, Christie has hired <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/chris-christies-not-so-terrible-day-117562.html" target="_blank">campaign staff</a> in New Hampshire , a key early primary state, defended NSA surveillance in a hawkish <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/18/chris-christie-backs-nsa-snooping-hawkish-foreign-policy-speech" target="_blank">foreign policy speech</a> to boost his hawkish credentials, and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/us/politics/Christies-Camp-Mobilizes-to-Salvage-White-House-Hopes.html" target="_blank">enlisted his wife to reassure donors</a> that the campaign they'd dreamed of back in 2013 was still possible, despite Christie's tanking poll numbers.</p><p>"It's clear he's definitely running for President," said Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University. "And that Bridgegate hasn't deterred him whatsoever. The best news for Christie is that the trial isn't going to be until November."</p><p>"He needs to rebrand himself as a straight talker, who can appease Democrats and actually win," he said. "How Bridgegate hurt Christie is that it halted any major accomplishments from getting done, and strengthened this narrative that he's a typical politician. And that's his whole thing: that he's not a typical politician."</p><p>There may still be time for Christie to make a comeback, Dworkin added, pointing out that the next six months could give the governor room to boost his poll numbers, and connect with voters in early primary states.</p><p>But Christie,in characteristic Christie fashion, doesn't seem too concerned with winning over hearts and minds. That much was clear at Wednesday's New Jersey Legislative Correspondents Club Show, an annual event where the governor and state house journalists take turns roasting each other, usually in jest. Usually, Christie shows a funny video, starring himself, but this year was different, with the governor launching into a profanity-laced diatribe against the reporters in the room.</p><p dir="ltr">"The reason we don't have a video is that we don't give a shit about you anymore," he announced. "We don't give a shit about this or any of you."</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Follow John Surico on</em><a href="https://twitter.com/johnsurico" target="_blank"><em> Twitter.</em></a></p>

<title>Why Did This Feminist Activist Promote a Tweet Telling Trans People to Kill Themselves? </title>

</p><p>
	<a href="https://twitter.com/caitlin_roper" target="_blank">Caitlin Roper</a> does not hate transgender people, but one Twitter troll wants you to believe she does.
</p><p>
	Roper is an Australian feminist activist who works for the grassroots organization 
	<a href="http://www.collectiveshout.org/" target="_blank">Collective Shout</a>. Collective Shout's mission is to call out the objectification of women in media. They've launched campaigns against <a href="http://www.collectiveshout.org/pop_this_dance_industry_caters_for_paedophilic_fantasies_underage_girls" target="_blank">the dancewear industry</a>, against <em><a href="http://www.collectiveshout.org/tags/playboy_merch" target="_blank">Playboy</a>,</em> and against <em><a href="http://www.collectiveshout.org/prostitution_survivors_call_on_target_to_withdraw_gta_v_for_extreme_violence_against_women" target="_blank">Grand Theft Auto V</a></em>.
</p><p>
	In October 2014, Roper tweeted an 
	<a href="https://www.change.org/p/kevin-mccabe-chairman-of-sheffield-utd-football-club-refuse-to-reinstate-ched-evans-as-a-player-at-sheffield-united" target="_blank">online petition against reinstating Ched Evans</a>, an English soccer player convicted of rape. After she shared the petition, Roper almost immediately began receiving rape and death threats via Twitter. Soon after those started, a Twitter user with the screename Nader created a fake profile purporting to be Roper. With the fake account, the user tweeted about sexual services that Roper supposedly provided, claiming she wanted to sell her underwear and that she enjoyed being raped. Roper <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/27/being-pimped-out-online-by-misogynist-harassers-will-not-stop-me-from-speaking-out" target="_blank">wrote about the experience</a> on <em>The Guardian</em>. In her piece, she describes the futility of going to the police, who asked her, "Why don't you just shut down your account?" Eventually, Roper was able to prove her real identity to Twitter, and they shut down the fake account.</p><p>
	Now, Roper is being targeted again with a similar method. This week, a new fake Caitlin Roper Twitter account has 
	<a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/05/20/twitter-users-shown-transphobic-promoted-tweet/" target="_blank">sprung up</a> to tweet transphobic hate speech. The troll behind this Twitter account managed to successfully run paid promotion on one tweet, which urged "trannies" to "commit suicide now." Twitter suspended the account 15 minutes after other users began reporting the tweet, but not before it had been seen by thousands of people.
	<!--recommended-->
</p><p>
	Roper believes she's found the perpetrator on—surprise!—
	<a href="https://boards.4chan.org/pol/thread/45416299" target="_blank">4chan</a>. (Warning: it takes about two posts for that thread to devolve into a mess of homophobia, transphobia and, somehow, racism.)
</p><p>
	The thread references Collective Shout's successful campaign to petition Kmart and Target to remove 
	<em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> from their stores, due to what Roper calls "extreme sexualized violence against women." (She's been targeted by 4chan users for this campaign before.) The thread also features other users congratulating the original poster for "doing God's work." I spoke to Roper about her history of being targeted for online abuse.

	The story with Nader, from last year, was that basically he left a trail linking back to his Facebook account. I think he'd targeted enough women already that there were other Twitter users who were quick to step in and pass along the information.
</p><p>
	<strong>Why do you think this most recent harassment campaign against you is also about transgender people? Do you think the person is sincerely transphobic, or just wants to paint you as such?</strong><br>
	I'm inclined to think this is more a deliberate attack on me—to silence me, discredit me, and intimidate me with an onslaught of abuse. I suspect this person/people have little regard for the safety or lives of transgender people, but ultimately I think they said something deliberately inflammatory to turn a backlash of abuse towards me. Some of the content on the 4chan post indicates some real hostility towards transgender people.
</p><p>
	<strong>Right. Why do you think they're targeting you specifically? Do you know anyone else who has been targeted using this "fake profile" method? </strong><br>
	I do know of other feminist activists, as well as prostitution survivors, who have been targeted in this way. Trolls seem to believe this is a great way to discredit and undermine our work. If they are damaging our reputations, there is some truth to this. However, the opposite is also true—my platform tends to grow when I'm targeted in this way, and in that sense, my activism goes to a wider audience.

	Out of all the potential targets on the internet, why choose Roper? Try as I might to suss out some quality that makes her a likely target, I simply couldn't find one. Roper works for a grassroots organization. She has about 2,800 Twitter followers. She's far from the most well-known feminist in the world. But she 
	<em>is</em> a woman who points out sexism in media, and <a href="http://feministfrequency.com/2012/06/07/harassment-misogyny-and-silencing-on-youtube/" target="_blank">as we've seen before</a>, that's a dangerous thing to be. For all of 4chan's talk of social justice activists' tendency to get "butthurt," their own butthurtiness comes to the surface as soon as someone says, "Hey, the depiction of women in this movie/show/video game isn't great."
</p><p>
	Roper's work doesn't focus on transgender issues, so the troll's decision to make transphobia his main angle only kind of makes sense. The user clearly thought it would alienate Roper's fellow feminists, while at the same time providing the user an outlet for their own pent-up aggression toward trans people. If I may offer some constructive criticism, I would say that this effort seems muddled and needs a clear direction. But such is the way of trolls angry at being unable to buy 
	<em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> at their local Kmart, the greatest injustice mankind has ever suffered.
</p><p>
	As for the real Roper, her resolve is staying strong. But online harassment of women remains a frustrating problem because of the anonymity the internet provides. Still, as more and more people become aware of the ubiquity of online harassment, feminist activists like Caitlin Roper gain more support everyday. Maybe that's why her trolls are so butthurt.

The site, which according to its <a href="http://adultfriendfinder.com/about-us/" target="_blank">about</a> page allows adults to not only "find online adult friends, but also horny matches and fuck buddies," was hacked by a man who goes by ROR[RG]. He <a href="http://gawker.com/adultfriendfinder-com-was-hacked-exposing-millions-of-1706311961" target="_blank">claims to have carried out the hack</a> because the site owed his friend nearly $250,000. The information exposed includes full names, email addresses (some with .gov accounts), marital status, IP addresses, and sexual orientation. ROR[RG] was considerate (?) enough to erase users' credit card information before uploading the information, which reportedly spanned 15 Microsoft Excel spreadsheets.</p><p>In a post on the forum, ROR[RG] wrote:</p><blockquote>it is a pervo website<br>they owe my guy money<br>had it coming clause<br>pay up or be fucked</blockquote><p>AdultFriendFinder has <a href="http://ffn.com/security-updates/" target="_blank">released a statement</a> regarding the hack. Read an excerpt below:</p><blockquote>FriendFinder Networks Inc. recently became aware of a potential data security incident. The security of our members' information remains our top priority and, upon learning of this incident, we took immediate action including:<br>-Launching an internal investigation to review and expand existing security protocols and processes<br>-Taking steps to protect our members such as temporarily disabling the username search function and masking usernames of any users we believe were affected by the security issue.<br>-This means that our members will still be able to log-in using their username and password but the search function will be disabled in an effort to protect members privacy. We are also in the process of communicating directly to members on how to update their usernames and passwords<br>-Working closely with Mandiant, a leading third-party forensics expert, to investigate the incident, review network security and remediate our system<br>-Notifying law enforcement, including the FBI, and coordinating with their investigation into this attack</blockquote><p>The statement concluded, "We will continue to work vigilantly to address this potential issue and will provide updates on this site as we learn more from our investigation.

	On a recent afternoon this
month, I stood in the lobby of a large building in the West Village, doing my
best to convince a doorman to let me up to the writer Vivian Gornick's
apartment.
</p><p>
	"There's no Gornick here,"
he said.
</p><p class="normal">
	"Are you sure?" I asked. "I
think there is. G, O, R—"
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="normal">
	He flipped open a binder
and trailed his finger down a list of residents.
</p><p>
	"Nope," he said, tapping
the binder. "No Gornick here."
</p><p>
	I went back outside and
wondered what to do. I made a phone call, and then another. Shortly thereafter,
I was allowed upstairs.
</p><p>
	"What do they mean I'm not on the list?" Vivian
Gornick said, opening her apartment door. "I've lived here 30 years."
</p><p>
	<i data-redactor-tag="i">The
Odd Woman and the City
	</i>, Gornick's latest memoir, gives a gleam to
these everyday moments—the fleeting misunderstandings, collisions, hostilities
and camaraderies that compose quotidian urban life. The book is a collection of
encounters, observations, and eavesdroppings from Gornick's daily walks through
Manhattan; it is studded with meditations on literature and loneliness, work and
love. A friend of Gornick's—a man she calls Leonard—moves through these pages
as well. The two meet weekly to walk, chat, and commiserate. He is, at times,
both foil and mirror.

</p><p>
	Gornick is a native New
Yorker, born and raised in the Bronx. Growing up in the Jewish ghetto, she writes, "Manhattan was Araby." As a journalist in 1970s New York, she covered—and
embraced—radical feminism, which continues to drive much of her criticism, which is characterized by its sharp and uncompromising nature. Gornick is also a teacher, having taught and worked in writing programs at Harvard and the University of Iowa, as well as the author of an invaluable book on
personal narrative, 
	<i data-redactor-tag="i">The Situation and the
Story
	</i>. Her world is both political and literary, and her writing—memoir and
criticism alike—is imbued with a clear-headed kindness, a genuine engagement
with the human condition. 
	<i data-redactor-tag="i">The Odd Woman
and the City is
	</i> colorful and gutting, full of dark humor, insight, and
heartbreak; the reader is never held at arm's length. It is a deeply human
book.
</p><p>
	In person Gornick was knowledgeable, curious, and generous, disinterested in small talk or frippery,
and had a Bronx accent that made me homesick (I left the city for San
Francisco two years ago). At a certain point, she schooled me briefly on the
history of women's rights; I deserved it. Though I intended to ask primarily
about the new book, our conversation meandered, detouring through feminism,
cultural decline, hookup culture, and publishing-industry economics. As we spoke, her two small cats fought zealously on the floor.

	<b>VICE: Some have positioned <i data-redactor-tag="i">The Odd Woman and the City </i>as a companion piece to <i>Fierce Attachments.</i> Do you see it that
way?
	<br>
	</b><b>Vivian Gornick: </b>It wasn't intentional. To some degree it's true, in
that the narrator of 
	<i>Fierce Attachments</i>
	is indeed me, 25 years ago, and to some extent the narrator of this book is me,
25 years later. The end of
	<i data-redactor-tag="i"> Fierce
Attachments
	</i> is a scene in which my mother says to me, "Why don't you go
already? I'm not holding you." I realize in a flash that I'm half in, half out.
I can't really leave: I can't stay, and I can't go. And that is the person who
writes that book.
</p><p class="normal">
	Now, here she
is, 25 years later. For better or for worse, this is where she stands. And you
can see that many of the strands that make up this collage are there in 
	<i>Fierce Attachments</i>: walking the streets
of the city, work, friendship. So to some degree it's true. 
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="normal">
	It started,
actually, as an essay about the city. It started, really, with this character
Leonard, a very good old friend. I've always wanted to write a book about the
two of us. I thought that our friendship was paradigmatic of our time and of our
place. I'm the odd woman, he's gay, we're in New York City. We've both been
involved in feminist and gay politics for 25, 30 years. We each live alone. And
that, especially—living alone—was central to our lives and to our situation.
Never before in history have so many people like us been living alone. In other
words, as I say in the book, we lived out our conflicts rather than our
fantasies. And this is where those conflicts have taken thousands of us. I
wanted to develop that. 
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="normal pullquote">
	"The thing
about friendships is that they're really just like marriages—they bring out in
you all that is neurotic, all that is strong. Every trait and characteristic
that you're capable of is there in a friendship."
</p><p class="normal">
	<b data-redactor-tag="b">There's a common language—however insufficient it may
be—for talking about familial relationships. There isn't a common language for
friendship. Did that surface for you in the process of writing this book?
	<br>
	</b>I feel very
close to the recognition that a friendship is as deeply psychologically
engaging as anything else. It draws from us our best and our worst. And I
couldn't agree more—there is no language for it.
</p><p class="normal">
	The thing that
does stay central to me is the recognition of what urban friendship is now. I
go to a party and somebody comes at me: "Oh, we were so tight two years ago."
Somebody else comes over: "Oh, I miss you"—she lives two blocks away from me.
And that has been on my mind for many, many years. What is that all about? How
does that happen? Why does that happen? It probably has been true in every
phase of life, but in the city it feels really vicious. And very, very central.
It doesn't feel vicious to me now, but that has been something to really think
about: the circumstantial nature of so many friendships. And the inability to
achieve stability in these relationships. It is as much an indicator of the
world we live in as anything else. 
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="normal">
	<b data-redactor-tag="b">Do you think that people collect other people in the
city to build a fortress against what would otherwise be relentless loneliness?
	<br>
	</b>Oh, of course. Since
we're all in so much crisis about marriage, and family—committing ourselves to
marriage, or being married, or staying married—friendship is absolutely vital.
The loneliness is generic; it's crude. All people living alone suffer
horrendously from loneliness. The thing about friendships coming and going, I
think that is true everywhere, at all times. But in the city, it feels
existential.
</p><p class="normal">
	The thing about
friendships is that they're really just like marriages—they bring out in you
all that is neurotic, all that is strong. Every trait and characteristic that
you're capable of is there in a friendship. You're the same people. You're not
a better friend than you are a love partner, or a daughter, or a parent, or any
of those things. I think you can learn as much about yourself in the world
through a single friendship as anything else.
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="normal">
	But in the
city, where everything is moving fast and there are thousands of ways to distract
yourself, it becomes apparent that friendships are either central or contingent.
And mainly they're contingent.

	"We live in
a world that has made endless use, in every way—culturally, politically,
socially—of women's subordinate position."
</p><p class="normal">
	<b data-redactor-tag="b">In your writing about the neighborhood where you grew
up, there are many friendships between people who might not necessarily find
each other under other circumstances. Friendship becomes a mode of survival and
self-preservation.
	<br>
	</b>The Bronx was
just like that: It was a ghetto. It was like a small town, and everybody knew
everybody else—which was often comforting, and often extremely confining,
imprisoning. There were so many people who had to know each other. There was no
way not to. You were glad, finally, to not have to know them when you moved to
Manhattan. And that is the trade-off. You move here and then you experience a
loneliness: crude, gross loneliness that you never experience when you're
living in a beehive, whether you like it or not. I know many people who began
to lead the life that I lead, and they just ran right back.

	<b data-redactor-tag="b">There's a conversation happening now, around women who
choose not to have children, who choose not to get married. This collection by

Shallow, and Self-Absorbed
	</i>—</b>
</p><p class="normal">
	I reviewed
that, in 
	<i>Bookforum</i>. [The collection]
was refreshingly clear-headed. Forty years ago, any woman who said, "I don't
want children" would have been branded unnatural, instantly. But it is true
that there have always been women who knew that they don't want children, who
knew that they'd be lousy mothers, and just never had a way to pursue.
</p><p class="normal">
	In this case,
all these people are writers, so they have the advantage of knowing that they
are true, solid, serious workers. And that becomes a metaphor, in a life, for
devotion to the experience of oneself as a worker, rather than as a mother and
a wife. If they were just ordinary people with no particular passion for any
particular work, it would be harder to put a name to it. In this case, these
writers have the excuse of saying, "I realized one way or another that I
couldn't work flat-out if I had children, and this is what I really choose to
do."

	<b>On the one hand, there's a book like <i data-redactor-tag="i">Selfish, Shallow, and Self-Absorbed</i>,
which points to people having passions and interests that have nothing to do
with family life and everything to do with work. Simultaneously we have [Facebook
CEO 
	</b><b>Sheryl Sandberg's] </b><b><i data-redactor-tag="i">Lean In</i></b><b data-redactor-tag="b"> and the pursuit of "having it all." The latter conversation seems to me
like an appropriation of the former, in some way.
	<br>
	</b>You think it's
manipulative on the part of capitalism? Is that what you mean? Well, all these
things are manipulations. Anything that becomes prescriptive is a manipulation.
Anything that becomes an ideology is a manipulation. When we started in the
1970s, all we were saying, essentially, was, "We have been described as
creatures who are happy to be mothers and wives and nothing else. This is not
who we are." We live in a world that has made endless use, in every way—culturally,
politically, socially—of women's subordinate position.
</p><p class="normal">
	Every two
minutes, there's another prescription: Lean in, lean out, do this, do that, you
can't have it all, you must have it all—I don't know what the hell it all
means. You know, it's an illusion, "have it all." Now one of the reasons you
can't have it all is because there is, as yet, no achievement of those early
goals. It's generational work; it's work of a thousand years. 
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="normal">
	That's what
you're living through—you're in the eye of the storm, and you will be as long
as you live. I never hope to see much more than I see now in my life. The
question of equality for men and women is so unbelievably fraught it brings to
the surface anxieties that are absolutely existential in nature. Metaphysical.
Really the heart of things. So people come up with prescriptions every two
minutes. And that's the journalistic need, to make news. Every five years the 
	<em data-redactor-tag="em">New

in a world whose rules we helped reduce without replacing them. So everything's
up in the air, and you're all on your own. But! There's so much more room for
you to struggle in an open field, to find your way. You're freer than ever
before to ask: What makes me feel exiled within myself? What doesn't? What
feels good? What doesn't? What's exhilarating, what's depressing? That's all
that you have. And it is true that people on the left, for instance—all my life—have
been looking on women's rights as an instrument of capitalist manipulations.
And I can't see it that way anymore. What we want is not revolutionary. On the
contrary, what we want is a more perfect democracy. We want what the democracy
promised. An equal shot at being equally miserable. An equal shot at being just
as unhappy as anybody else, but

thing you've really got, but you do have that. I believe firmly that that is
how you change the world. And as old as I am, I take that as my responsibility.
And I will take that until I die.
</p><p>
	<b>In <i data-redactor-tag="i">The Odd Woman
and the City
	</i>, you write about the performance, in a friendship, of one's
best self. What is the relationship between writing and performance of this best
self? 
	<br>
	</b>What I want is
to create a character who will tell the story that needs to be told. In
writing, what you must be devoted to is the writing. In other words, you are
devoted here to making the writing be the best it can be. I don't want or need
to be a virtuous self through the narrator that I create. That narrator has to
be able to serve the story. And by the way, in the book I say that that's
	<i> not</i> our culture anymore: That culture
of people showing each other their best selves was 100 years ago. It was a romantic notion.
</p><p class="normal">
	<b>Friendship has become more confessional.<br>
	</b>Now we share
our worst selves. We're in the therapeutic culture. We share our angers, our
hungers, our jealousies, our humiliations—that's the nature of friendship,
now. You know, two women can run into each other after not having seen each
other in 30 years, and sit down for a cup of coffee. In 20 minutes, they're
telling each other all.
</p><p class="normal">
	<b data-redactor-tag="b">I think it's a mode of protection. Sharing an intimacy
is a way to give someone what appears to be part of yourself but actually
obscures what you hold dear.
	<br>
	</b>You can sit
down with somebody and they can reveal in 20 minutes how bad they feel about
this, that, or the other, and it makes you assume that because this person has
told you how bad they can feel, they made themselves vulnerable to you, and
therefore, out of that you can expect a certain kind of behavior. And that is
not true. But it was the same when people only showed each other their virtue.
That wasn't true either.

I feel like I have a comrade. When I don't, I just ignore it.
</p><p class="normal">
	I know many,
many people who spend their lives bemoaning the loss of New York. I never felt
that. For me the city is unchanging. What I appreciate in New York is watching
the 50 different ways in which people survive. By

human beings
	</em>. I love that. I see that all the time, everywhere. My mother died
at 94—she never stopped having adventures on the street. She'd walk up to the
box office at the New York City Ballet, and she'd put her hand down on the
grille and say to some young person behind the grille in the middle of the day,
"I'm 85 years old, and I live on Social Security, and I love ballet. 
	<em><i data-redactor-tag="i">Do something</i> for me</em>." And they would. <o:p></o:p>

	</b>It's amazing.
It changes, and it never changes. The people 
	<i>doing</i>
	it are changed perhaps, but the essence doesn't change.
</p><p class="normal">
	<b data-redactor-tag="b">There have been a number of books published recently
that turn inward, emphasizing narratorial interiority and realism. Daily life
is documented, analyzed: Not much happens, but there's a lot of internal
processing, a lot of anxiety. People seem very excited about these books right
now, myself included, but I don't know why, or why now.
	<br>
	</b>It's in the
wind. All these young literary men, all they write about is how depressed they
are, how nothing feels real, how they can't experience anything.
</p><p class="normal">

happens when a culture's falling apart. I really do.
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="normal">
	<b>What do you mean?<br>
	</b>Well, I think
this has happened, no doubt, in the past: [Goethe's]
	<i> The Sorrows of Young Werther</i>, or something like that. I think that the more a culture
stops giving satisfaction, the more people start navel-gazing. There are so
many young men writing literary books, all about how depressed they are, and
how they read email all day long, right? Isn't that right? Every time I feel
lousy, I go back to look at the email? And they're praised to the skies. The
reviews write about them as if it's first-rate literature.
</p><p class="normal">

	</b>That's right,
it's been forever.
</p><p class="normal">
	I'm sure this
story is apocryphal, but it is said that when Sparta and Athens were involved
in the Peloponnesian War and Athens was going under, philosophers proliferated
in the streets. All Athens had been—its great contribution to the world, to
life, to history—was its philosophers. And as the culture was dying, there were
more and more third-rate versions of what had once been great.
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="normal">
	Somehow it
feels like that now, as the book-publishing world is dying and print is dying, there's
all this incredible visual noise created by technology. There's mass culture
like never before in history—such a mass culture. Which means culture that's
sinking to the lowest common denominator. And all of that is quite depressing.
And I think it's out of that, that this kind of literature is why people are
turning so interior. 
	<o:p></o:p>
</p><p class="normal">
	That's why
we're all writing memoirs instead of novels. Novel-writing is not so promising
anymore. But the need for narrative persists. It will persist as long as human
beings are alive. That need to tell a story—that need to create order out of
the chaos of experience—will never stop. It's like air and light, food.

<title>What Does the Mayor of London Actually Do?</title>

	<em>This article originally appeared on VICE UK.</em>
</p><p>
	With the 
	<a href="http://www.vice.com/read/explaining-election-15-to-americans-467" target="_blank">general election</a> only just out of the way, the contest for the May 2016 London Mayoral election is already kicking into gear. With Boris standing down so he can dedicate his full attention to plotting the political demise of David Cameron, the competition is wide open. Several Labour and Conservative politicians are already jostling to be the official candidate to try and replace him. Everyone's aware that the mayor of London is a pretty big deal, but what do they actually do?
</p><p>
	In most places, the ability to wear an oversized neck chain and turn up with a giant pair of scissors whenever a new Asda opens is pretty much the only qualification necessary to hold the office of mayor. In London, whoever wins will get a £17 billion [$26 billion] budget to play with and will set out their vision for the future of London. They will also appoint a team of deputy mayors and advisors, which is presumably how Boris has juggled the role with writing a book, a newspaper column, and becoming an MP.
</p><!--recommended--><p>
	As mayor, you don't have absolute power, apart from the power to get stuck on a zip wire. Any decisions have to be made within the laws set by central government, so you can't just invade Berkshire or bring back the death penalty. There is also the London Assembly to deal with—a body of 25 elected members whose job it is to hold the mayor to account. But you do get to decide the overall strategies for things like housing, culture, and policing. For example, the mayor decides how many houses we need to build in the capital, while day-to-day decisions on planning applications are handled by the London boroughs in accordance with the rules set by the mayor.
</p><p>
	The mayor's responsibilities can be grouped into a few key areas. Here's a guide to which parts of your life they're in charge of.
</p><p class="has-image">
	[body_image width='1000' height='664' path='images/content-images/2015/05/22/' crop='images/content-images-crops/2015/05/22/' filename='what-does-the-london-mayor-actually-do-553-body-image-1432292306.jpg' id='58801']
</p><p class="photo-credit">

</p><h2>FIRE AND EMERGENCY PLANNING</h2><p>
	It's the mayor's responsibility to plan what happens when the shit really hits the fan—like if there's a terrorist attack or World War III breaks out. Don't worry, Boris Johnson hasn't personally bashed out a plan of action for a nuclear winter on the margins of an old copy of the 
	<em>Evening Standard</em>. He just has to make sure someone else has a plan. The details are worked out by the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, which manages the fire brigade and works out what to do in the event an emergency. The mayor's job is limited to appointing its board members and setting its budget. Under Boris, this has meant closing ten fire stations, a decision described by the Fire Brigades Union as "deeply troubling" and by the mayor's press team as "efficient."

</p><h2>PLANNING<br>
<!--[endif]-->
<o:p></o:p></h2><p class="MsoNormal">
	There are plenty of ways
in which the mayor can leave their mark on the city. For starters, you get to
write the 
	<a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/planning/london-plan" target="_blank">London Plan</a>, which covers everything from housing to
the environment and sets out where development should take place. You also get
the final say over any major projects—most notably, tall buildings. While it
was central government that ultimately approved the Shard, it was helped in no
small part by Ken Livingstone's support. In 2012, when the tower was completed,
Livingstone said the Shard would "define London." Which is undeniably true,
particularly if you define London as a playground for the super-rich, dominated
by a ludicrous phallic symbol of Qatari wealth.

</p><hr><h2>HOUSING</h2><p class="MsoNormal">
	Monuments to capitalist
excess might be in abundant supply, but places to live are not. To tackle this
problem, the mayor has to produce a housing strategy which outlines the kind of
housing the city needs and where it should go. Traditionally, this involves
setting a lot of ambitious targets, which developers then 
	<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-28438437" target="_blank">fail to meet every year</a>.
On one of the most important issues facing our generation, the mayor has, so
far at least, proved powerless. Still, better make this vote count, because
spiraling rents will have forced you out of London well before the next
election.

</p><h2>TRANSPORT</h2><p class="MsoNormal">
	London's transport
network is managed by TfL, which in turn is managed by the mayor who decides
the budget, strategy, and and appoints the board. For many years, the main part
of this job has been to argue about tube strikes with RMT union leader Bob
Crow. Sadly, Crow passed away last year, leaving it up to new leader Mick Cash to point
out that maybe it's not a great idea to close down all the ticket offices,
leaving late-night travelers to negotiate scenes of Mad Max-style anarchy
armed only with their addled wits and malfunctioning Oyster cards.

</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	Of course, the mayor has
other transport responsibilities, such as choosing which bank gets to pick the
color of the Boris bikes and deciding whether fares go up or down (spoiler: They're not going down). Then there are more outlandish projects, such as the
Thames cable car. Boris has described it as a "howling success"; an interesting
euphemism for a project which consumed tens of millions in public funds and is
now used by a handful of tourists and

</p><p class="photo-credit">

</p><h2>ENVIRONMENT</h2><p>
	Air quality, water, waste, and climate change all come under the mayor's remit and there is at least one strategy for all of them. The motivation for this is 
	<a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Municipal%20Waste_FINAL.pdf" target="_blank">spelled out</a> by Boris in his municipal waste management strategy, where he outlines the need to recognize the "massive economic opportunity inherent in London's waste" and "to turn waste into a lucrative commodity." Rather than, say, preventing irreversible climate change and the extinction of the human race.
</p><p class="has-image">

</p><p class="photo-credit">
	Photo by Jake Lewis
</p><h2>CULTURE</h2><p class="MsoNormal">
	Despite being one of the
most important parts of life in the city, London's mayor doesn't have all that
much power where culture is concerned. The role is mostly limited to producing
a woolly cultural strategy and organizing 
	<a href="https://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/arts-culture/gigs" target="_blank">busking competitions</a>.
That means limited opportunities to tackle the cultural apocalypse which has
seen the demise of various nightlife institutions in recent months. In fairness
to Boris, he did recently launch a 
	<a href="http://musicvenuetrust.com/london-taskforce/" target="_blank">Music Venue Taskforce</a>,
aimed at protecting these "teeming wombs of London talent." Unfortunately,
London's overall trajectory still points towards a cultural wasteland populated
only by estate agents who long ago gave up trying to sell flats to each other
and are now trying to escape their ennui by drinking themselves to death at All
Bar One. Perhaps a more interventionist approach is needed.
</p><h2>HEALTH</h2><p>
	Health isn't a major concern of the mayo—mostly that's handled by central government through the NHS. But there is a responsibility to tackle "health inequality." Apparently, every tube stop you travel east from central London, the life expectancy in the surrounding neighborhood drops by a year, as you get further and further away from a life of organic quinoa salads and life-span enhancing luxury hand soaps.
</p><p class="has-image">
	[body_image width='640' height='427' path='images/content-images/2015/05/22/' crop='images/content-images-crops/2015/05/22/' filename='what-does-the-london-mayor-actually-do-553-body-image-1432291670.jpg' id='58790']
</p><p class="photo-credit">
	Photo by Oscar Webb.
</p><h2>POLICING</h2><p class="MsoNormal">
The mayor sets the
budget and priorities of the Met Police and, in theory, holds the criminal
justice system to account. In reality, Boris used his powers to 
	<a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/mayor/boris-johnson-well-keep-water-cannon-for-london-despite-home-secretary-halting-their-use-10148413.html" target="_blank">buy a second-hand water cannon</a>
	from Germany. Permission to use the cannon is yet to be granted by the Home
Office, although the prospect of civil unrest during five more years of Tory
rule makes the go-ahead seem all the more likely. So, it'll probably come down
to the next mayor to decide whether or not to actually use it. If you're the
kind of person who finds yourself at street protests, the person you vote for
next year will decide whether you're being leveled by a water cannon or merely
having your head bashed in with a police baton.

	<em><a href="https://www.vice.com/read/thomas-cromwell-dead-since-1540-is-televisions-latest-hot-star-1540" target="_blank">Wolf Hall</a></em> and fantasies like <i>The Musketeers </i>and <i>Penny Dreadful </i>eagerly seeking historical detail, a process with which historians are <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/mar/24/game-of-thrones-realistic-history" target="_blank">happy</a> to <a href="http://www.livescience.com/44599-medieval-reality-game-of-thrones.html" target="_blank">assist</a>, whether it's checking the accuracy of the architecture, execution styles, or <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/30/wolf-hall-codpieces-too-small-says-literature-researcher" target="_blank">size (and curvature) of the codpieces</a>.
</p><p>
	Viewers have been particularly interested in fact-checking, as it were, HBO's
	<em><a href="http://www.vice.com/read/the-telescoping-histories-and-myths-behind-game-of-thrones-747">Game of Thrones</a>. </em>The most recent episode pushed the historical envelope once more, but this time in ways that have opened up a <a href="http://theconcourse.deadspin.com/game-of-thrones-is-gross-exploitative-and-totally-out-1705235364" target="_blank">sharp</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2015/05/19/game-of-thrones-has-always-been-a-show-about-rape/" target="_blank">debate</a>. As this episode closed, a character cheered by fans for her increasing independence, Sansa Stark (played by Sophie Turner), was raped by her new husband, the sadistic Ramsey Bolton (Iwan Rheon), as her childhood friend Theon was forced to watch. The marital rape of such a sympathetic character appears to have been <a href="http://www.themarysue.com/we-will-no-longer-be-promoting-hbos-game-of-thrones/" target="_blank">one assault too many</a> for some devotees of a show (and series of novels) that makes much of its sensitivity to "<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/mar/24/game-of-thrones-realistic-history">reality of the times</a>" of its medievalized setting.
</p><!--recommended--><p>
	But
what times are these? After all, we're talking about a show with dragons, 
	<a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Warg">wargs</a>, and <a href="http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/White_Walkers">white walkers</a>. Beyond the fantastic
in its setting however, neither 
	<i data-redactor-tag="i">Game of
Thrones 
	</i>creator George R. R. Martin, the showrunners, nor the fans should
pat themselves on the back for their historical savvy in depicting "realistic" medieval sex, for such an idea sweeps under the rug both the complexity of the
European Middle Ages and of our own era. In short, the idea of the "reality of the times" lies to us about our past and our present.
</p><p>
	We
have no idea how frequent rape really was in the Middle Ages. What we do know
is that 
	<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/09/rape-in-america-cdc-study_n_5784686.html"><u data-redactor-tag="u">nearly
one out of every five American women will be raped in her lifetime</u></a>. We also know
that in medieval England, for example, according to statute law, rape of a
virgin was legally equated with maiming, that is, losing a limb. One could not
stitch Jaime Lannister's hand back on in medieval England, or replace Sansa
Stark's lost virginity.
</p>[youtube src='//www.youtube.com/embed/NCW3RdUiYYQ' width='560' height='315']<p>
	According
to early English statutes, the penalty on conviction for rape and for maiming
were identical: execution or exile. The penalties for rape or maiming in the US
today vary, but look mild in comparison. In either case, the penalties don't seem to matter, as conviction rates for rape in the
Middle Ages were 
	<u><a href="https://rainn.org/get-information/statistics/reporting-rates">even lower
than our own
	</a> (where only 2 percent of rapes will lead to any prison time)</u>, though not by much. No matter how frequently rape occurs,
rapists are not normally now and never have been convicted and legally
punished. In that, at least, 
	<i data-redactor-tag="i">Game of
Thrones 
	</i>may say something about reality.
</p><p>
	We
also know that medieval people lapped up literature featuring rape, as we
apparently still do today. In just one example, Geoffrey Chaucer's canonical
14th-century work, 
	<i>The Canterbury Tales, </i>we find it full of sexual violence. The action of "<a href="http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~chaucer/teachslf/wbt-par.htm" target="_blank">The Wife of Bath's Tale</a>"<i> </i>begins with the rape of a virgin: "He saw a maiden walking before him / Of which maiden straightway, despite all she could do / By utter force, he took away her maidenhead." In "<a href="http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~chaucer/teachslf/phys-par.htm" target="_blank">The Physician's Tale</a>,"<i> </i>the main character is
so afraid that his daughter, Virginia, is going to be raped that he kills her
to prevent it: 
	"There are two ways, either death or shame / That thou most suffer; alas, that I was born!"
</p><p class="pullquote">
	Consent mattered in medieval culture just as it does in modern culture.
</p><p>
	Sometimes medieval literature makes fun of rape victims, as Chaucer's "
	<a href="http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~chaucer/teachslf/rvt-par.htm" target="_blank">The Reeve's Tale</a>"
	<i> </i>seems to do, when two college students take revenge against a "proud" miller by forcing sex on his unwitting wife and daughter, and the attacks are played up for bawdy laughs: "His wife is screwed, and his daughter also. / Lo, this is how it is when a miller is false!" In "The Franklin's Tale," a wife, Dorigen, may be threatened with rape when
she jokingly agrees to sleep with another man if he can remove the dangerous
rocks from the coastline: The man creates the illusion that the rocks are gone,
and Dorigen feels forced to consent to have sex that she most definitely does
not desire. This complex dilemma sometimes leads audiences to blame Dorigen for
her hasty promise.
</p><p>
	In
1382, the English parliament downgraded rape as an offense in the Statute of
Rapes, but it proved a hard sell. Lesser sentences, similar to those rape
carries today, were created, because a friend of the powerful house of
Lancaster was under investigation for rape. While politics determining law mirrors 
	<i>Game of Thrones' </i>"reality of
the times" closely, what the historical record shows is that medieval lawyers
continued attempting to prosecute rapists under the older, more stringent law.
</p><p>
	Sometimes medieval literature, too, expresses compassion for raped women, and
for women threatened with rape. The word 
	<em>rape</em> comes from the Latin word 
	<i>raptus</i>, or "to seize," the same word that gives us
	<em>raptor</em> today. For medieval people, a raped woman was as powerless against her
attacker as a mouse against a hawk. She was carried away from her world and her
life and control over her body. The Latin word itself is a powerful indication
of cultures that sympathize with raped women.

	[youtube src='//www.youtube.com/embed/QbG_ktYFNPE' width='100%' height='360px']
</p><hr><p>
	In
short, medieval people cared about the victims of rape. Take the story of
Lucretia—retold by Chaucer, Gower, Lydgate, and other medieval poets—which
shows a sensitivity to the rape of wives even when the law was less clear. The
story climaxes with Lucretia killing herself out of shame over her own rape, but
in most medieval versions of the story, her husband and other family members do
not blame her. Rather, they support her and want her to live. In Gower's version "her
husband, a sorrowful man / comforted her as much as he could / as did her father
too and together they swore / that they were not angry with her [because she had
been raped]."
</p><p>
	Medieval
age of consent laws were intended to ensure that a wife-to-be was old enough to
know what she was about to do before she went to the church door to be married.
If a woman gave consent to be married and had consensual sex with her husband,
then no one in medieval Europe but the Pope could part the couple.
</p><p>
	The
historical Paston family in 15th-century England 
	<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=dD9-9YCQBywC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq=paston+family+medieval+rape+england&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bzgs8UIcaE&amp;sig=yN7cmRclzFx__vxBzjpMA4vLKL4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VzdfVePCBJKlyASJsIH4Aw&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=paston%20family%20medieval%20rape%20england&amp;f=false">faced this reality</a> when one of
their daughters, Margery, married a man the family had not approved of. The
Church acknowledged the ceremony, and Margery upheld her vow and
consummation, however, and so the family was forced to accept it. Both vow and
consummation were necessary, and the lack of one or the other could invalidate
the marriage. Back then, as now, people might marry for a variety of reasons,
but then, as now, consummation was supposed to be consensual.
</p><p>
	Consent
mattered in medieval culture just as it does in modern culture. Yet modern rape
statistics demand that we recognize that it still happens with alarming frequency. The
debate on whether Sansa Stark's rape was worth showing hides both how modern medieval culture was and how medieval our own culture still is. As 
	<a href="http://lareviewofbooks.org/essay/game-of-thrones-season-5-unbowed-unbent-unbroken">Sarah Mesle</a> in the <i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i> wrote, "This episode of <i>Game of Thrones</i> does to viewers what the world so often does to women: It mistakes presence for consent." The sexual reality of 
	<i>Game of Thrones </i>is, in fact, our own.

sexuality to his rugby teammates, many told him to quit. He'd hid the fact he was
gay  because he struggled with the sport's macho culture and boys club attitude.

	<span lang="EN-US">After being bombarded with abuse over the
following few years, it all became too much. "I ended up quitting rugby because
of the homophobia," Simon tells VICE. "Some of my teammates questioned whether
I should even be on the team after I came out. When you're a teenager
questioning who you are and struggling with yourself, you can imagine how hard
it is having everyone putting you down week-in, week-out."
	<o:p></o:p></span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	<span lang="EN-US">Simon eventually found acceptance with the
Sydney Convicts, Australia's first gay rugby union team. After relocating to
Canada, he developed a passion for a very different sport—he's now the only
openly out bobsled athlete in the world.
	<o:p></o:p></span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	<span lang="EN-US">Simon's early experiences of homophobia in sports are common for gay and bi athletes. Despite the progress made by out athletes like Aussie Rules footballer Jason Ball, NZ rugby player/netballer <a href="https://www.facebook.com/louisawall.labourmanurewa" target="_blank">Louisa Wall</a>, and Australian Olympians </span>Natalie Cook, Matthew Mitcham, and <span lang="EN-US">Mathew Helm, a</span> recent
report states Australian and New Zealand LGBT athletes are more like to hide
their sexuality than many other nations. The 
	<a href="http://www.viewdocsonline.com/document/p0wnss" target="_blank">Out in the Fields study</a>
	points to familiar seeds of anxiety and aggression like school PE classes, and
our arguably acceptable culture of casual homophobic slurs as catalysts for
ongoing homophobia in sport.
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	<span lang="EN-US">Nearly 10,000 people were surveyed for the
study, with a cross section of gay, bisexual, and heterosexuals asked about
their experiences of homophobia in sport. More than 3,000 Australians and 600
New Zealanders shared their stories from the field and in the stands. "For many
people, sporting culture has not seen the same progress as observed in broader
society," the report reads. "The study found few positive signs in any country
that LGB people are welcome and safe playing team sports." 
	<o:p></o:p></span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	<span lang="EN-US">The report offers insight into the
discriminatory sporting culture that leads many LGBT athletes to be too afraid
to reveal their sexuality to teammates. Of those surveyed, 87 percent of
Australian gay men and 75 percent of lesbian women are completely or partially
closeted while playing sport. The numbers are just as dire for New Zealand.
	<o:p></o:p></span>
	<!--recommended-->
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	<span lang="EN-US">Former footy player Travis Burridge was
forced to quit playing when he was 17 over fears of abuse and discrimination
because he was gay. "There's so much machoness, it's a boys club," he told
VICE. "If you don't fit in that boys club you get ridiculed for it, and
unfortunately being gay means you don't fit the boys club sometimes."
	<o:p></o:p></span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	<span lang="EN-US">Dr. Grant O'Sullivan from Victoria
University, who helped review the surveys, tells VICE it's this insular
attitude and pressure to fit in that makes participation hard for LGBT players.
"Anyone who is different is seen as a threat to that cohesion," he concludes.</span></p><hr><p>

</p><hr><p class="MsoNormal">
	<span lang="EN-US">The impact of casual homophobic slurs and
asides is a recurring theme in the report and personal accounts. The derogatory
use of words like "gay" from a very young age, especially in PE class, can have
a damaging effect on LGBT players. Nearly half of those surveyed had been
personally targeted with words like "faggot" or "dyke," and four out of five
Aussies had witnessed or experienced homophobia while playing sport or watching
from the stands. "The language, whether it's indirectly or directly homophobic,
does have a connection with poorer mental health on those environments," Grant
says.
	<o:p></o:p></span>
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	<span lang="EN-US">Not surprisingly, for LGBT athletes who do
make the decision to come out, there is usually a supportive friend within the
team, and an accepting environment free from homophobic slurs—however casual
they might be. "People will come out when the environment is safe for them. If
you create a safe environment, with good straight allies and policies," Grant
notes.
	</span>
</p><p>
	<span lang="EN-US">It's also important to have well-known Australian athletes who have come out. There are already a few professional LGBT sports people, including footy player Jason Ball who has been pushing the AFL to tackle homophobia for more than three years, and cricketer Alex Blackwell, who become only the second international player to come out in 2013.  
	<o:p></o:p></span>
</p><p>
	A number of important recommendations are
included in the report, such as improving education for young children and
their teachers, as well as national sporting bodies adopting and promoting a
clear anti-homophobia message. In the wake of the dire findings, many of the
major codes in Australia and New Zealand have reaffirmed their commitment to
tackle the issue. Over the weekend the AFL Player's Association launched an anti-homophobia campaign with the help of some of the biggest players in the game. 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9zEy6WQ-jI" target="_blank">The video</a> features the stars denouncing discrimination against LGBT players and the use of homophobic language in the sport.
</p><p class="MsoNormal">
	<span lang="EN-US">But as Travis adds, the primary focus is
that young LGBT athletes don't feel like they're being forced out of their
sports. It's the culture that needs to change, not them. "You're always going
to have obstacles, it's how you tackle those obstacles that makes you a better
person. If you love sport, and you think you can change it, do it."

	EA Sports' 
	<em>FIFA</em> series rules the world of soccer video games. It is <a href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2015-01-05-fifa-15-was-the-best-selling-game-in-the-uk-in-2014" target="_blank">the most popular game in the United Kingdom</a>. Everyone is aware of it—from the headset-sporting teen, sitting in his bedroom uploading his latest wonder goal to his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uub9cj-waZA" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, to the petrified parent, making her annual December pilgrimage to the local GameStop. <em>FIFA</em> is a giant, the undisputed champion in its field. It's precision engineered to suck players in for hours on end, and then inform their conversations when they're not glued to the screen. It can overtake lives entirely. It's pretty good, basically.
</p><p>
	There was a time though, in the not so distant past, when 
	<em>FIFA</em> wasn't alpha and omega in the world of soccer sims. Before Electronic Arts had won the war, another ruled. Some might call this period the<em> Pro Evo</em> dynasty. And my first contact with Konami's once-triumphant series was so long ago, before it was even known as <em>Pro Evo</em>, that it deserves one of those swirly transition effects.
</p><!--recommended--><p>
	I was nine years old, sat in my friend's bedroom in North London and, as was the fashion, had a dreadful curtained haircut. It was the middle of summer, soccer was "coming home" and I was watching my mate's older brother school him on 
	<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Superstar_Soccer_Deluxe" target="_blank">International Super Star Soccer Deluxe</a></em> for the Super Nintendo. I played once or twice, got soundly battered and returned to my spot by the window, looking out at the hot, sticky cloud that seemed to hang over suburban London at that time of year.
</p><p>
	Aesthetically, the experience was unfulfilling. Constrained by 16bit processing power the graphics looked cartoonish and archaic to me—someone who had just witnessed 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5MjaGNEFjo" target="_blank">the real-life England team trounce Holland on ITV</a>. What's more, it didn't feel like you were playing soccer. It felt more like a beat-'em-up transposed onto a soccer pitch.
</p><p>
	Two years later, and it's summer again. Instead of looking up at the brooding steam that sits over London in June, I'm staring at the clear, pristine sky of the Irish midlands. The 1998 World Cup is on, and I am drinking in every second.
</p><p>
	While Euro '96 was the first tournament I watched with any interest, France '98 obsessed me. Everything that had gone beforehand seemed analogue to me, whereas this was digital, and global and now—and I was hooked. This was as good as I had anticipated, and much of that expectation had been built because of 
	<em>ISS Pro '98</em>.
</p><p class="has-image">[body_image width='1024' height='768' path='images/content-images/2015/05/22/' crop='images/content-images-crops/2015/05/22/' filename='konamis-iss-and-pro-evo-are-the-football-games-that-defined-my-youth-831-body-image-1432281123.jpg' id='58716']</p><p class="photo-credit">
	A screen shot from 'International Superstar Soccer Pro '98,', 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_02AMVjjZ54" target="_blank">via YouTube</a>.</p><p>
	Hundreds of miles of motorway, one Stena ferry, seasickness and here I was—new country, new currency, new school, new friends, and a new life. My parents wanted to give my sister and I a better life, one filled with daylong bike rides and night-time doors left unlocked. So I can understand my father's annoyance at the sight of me sitting on my bed, alongside newly-made friends, playing 
	<em>FIFA '97</em>. He'd rather I was outside, hanging off trees or throwing rocks into cow shit. But I had to ingratiate myself somehow, and the PlayStation was the totem around which I'd build my new life.
</p><p>
	<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCaxeZWv80s" target="_blank">FIFA '97</a></em> promised much—hundreds of players, accurate rosters, and modern polygon-based graphics—yet within months it had bored me. The game looked nothing like the soccer I had witnessed the previous summer in London, nor did it play like it. The game could be beaten easily and, most irritatingly of all, the details let it down. Despite having all the players, they didn't resemble them—the very bald, very pale Gianluca Vialli was portrayed by a figure tanned to the point of Ronseal.
</p><p>
	But it wouldn't be long before I was free from my 
	<em>FIFA</em>-induced disappointment.  One Saturday afternoon, while waiting for my mother to finish whatever it was she was doing, I walked around a now-defunct independent video rental store and there it was, third row down, between <em>Abe's Oddysee </em>and <em>Destruction Derby</em>:  <em>International Superstar Soccer Pro '98</em>. The cover featured Fabrizio "the silver fox" Ravanelli and Paul Ince fronting at each and little else, certainly nothing to suggest the magic within.
</p><p class="has-image">[body_image width='650' height='650' path='images/content-images/2015/05/22/' crop='images/content-images-crops/2015/05/22/' filename='konamis-iss-and-pro-evo-are-the-football-games-that-defined-my-youth-831-body-image-1432281142.jpg' id='58717']</p><p class="photo-credit">
	The cover of 'ISS Pro '98,' in the UK at least.</p><p>
	Unlike EA Sports' game of the same time, 
	<em>FIFA: Road to World Cup 98</em>, <em>ISS</em> didn't feature a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xN0fLiun-bY" target="_blank">flashy intro</a>—just a simple logo and "press start to continue." The menu was spartan—Exhibition, League, and Cup options, and All-Star Mode. Compared to the comprehensive <em>FIFA</em>, it seemed like a basic coin-op affair.
</p><p>
	But you can fall in love in a second. And for me, it happened the moment my first, tentative exhibition game began. Again, the gloss was minimal: the match was played in a stadium that, by modern standards, looked like someone's first attempt at 
	<em>Minecraft</em>; the crowd was a smeared mess of faces punctuated by unfeasibly large flags.
</p><p>
	Any fleeting doubts evaporated when the teams emerged. I still remember my first game—Brazil against France—a game I would be watching for real soon enough, slack jawed as 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-I25588h9o" target="_blank">the home side became world champions</a>. Konami didn't have the license to the real names of the players, so instead a wink-and-nudge approach was taken—Cafu became "Kafou," Desailly changed to "Desarie," and Ronaldo, the world's most famous player, was "Ronarid." But it didn't matter; as in an instant the players were distinguished and recognizable.

	<a href="http://www.gamekult.com/jeux/test-iss-pro-evolution-J402t.html" target="_blank">via Gamekult.com</a>.</p><p>
	France's Zidane ("Zedene") had his Friar Tuck bald patch, Ronaldo sported his own iconic electric-blue boots and, most astounding of all, Roberto Carlos had his own true-to-life way of striking the ball. 
	<em>FIFA</em> may have had every team in international soccer, but <em>ISS Pro</em>'s 54 were exact replicas of the real-life thing—Taribo West sported <a href="http://resources2.news.com.au/images/2010/05/19/1225868/522018-taribo-west.jpg" target="_blank">lime green dreadlocks</a>, Michael Owen's pace was instantly recognizable, and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/nov/10/croatia-euro-2012-play-offs" target="_blank">Croatia's iconic kit</a> was perfectly replicated.
</p><p>
	Of course, all this would have meant nothing had the game been utter shit. In the same vein, amazing gameplay can cover a multitude of sins—yes, the crowd looked terrible, the presentation didn't come close to anything resembling polished, and match commentator 
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QJuWg-91MA" target="_blank">Tony Gubba sounded like a hostage reading a list of demands at gunpoint</a>. But none of that mattered because the gameplay consumed you in ways never before seen in a soccer sim—the opposition seemed to adjust to and counter your tactics, wingbacks bombed ahead, and goalkeepers advanced to snuff out danger. Compared to the frenzy of <em>FIFA</em>, <em>ISS Pro '98 </em>played like a game of chess.</p><blockquote><a href="https://sports.vice.com/en_uk/topic/football" target="_blank"><strong>Read about football, real football, on VICE Sports</strong></a></blockquote><p>The pinnacle of 
	<em>ISS Pro</em>'s gameplay, and subsequently <em>Pro Evolution Soccer</em>'s, was the through pass. This simple, elegant edition to soccer gaming changed everything. The kick-and-rush style of playing, encouraged by <em>FIFA</em>, was dead. Instead, the emphasis was placed on thoughtful possession, to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiki-taka" target="_blank">tiki-taka</a> your team into position and then, with a single tap of the triangle button, split the opposition defense in two.
</p><p>
	The game didn't just make you feel you were playing "real" soccer, it felt like you were improving it.

Contenders to the crown arrived—new editions of 
	<em>FIFA</em>, each with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Cg1DA_J5eU" target="_blank">a new bell and whistle attached</a>, Michael "Have Fun" Owen's <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgy4XNYvlLE " target="_blank">World League Soccer</a></em> and the very fucking awful <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddrpynKqxcU" target="_blank">David Beckham Soccer</a></em>. But none came close to the enthrallment that <em>ISS Pro</em> offered.</p><p>
	From the halcyon summer of 1998 grew an obsession that came to define my life. Post-school entertainment swerved 
	<em>Hollyoaks</em> or <em>Neighbours</em> in favor of the near-impossible task of taking Japan to the World Cup final. The notion of exam revision only crossed my mind in the brief moments I spent wolfing down my dinner before returning to my room to engage in virtual sporting glories.
</p><p>
	By the time I scraped my way into third-level education I found that the bug had gripped many young "men" my age. Instead of Tuesday nights spent in vain wandering the sticky floors of heaving college fleshpots in an attempt to merely talk to a girl, there we were, half a dozen of us, grouped in a living room thick with smoke, surrounded by remains of oven pizzas, hunched forward, controllers in our sweaty palms as the drama of a 
	<em>Pro Evo 5 </em>"winner stays on" contest played out.
</p><p>
	A game (or several) of 
	<em>Pro Evo</em> became our focal point around which tales were told, cans were sunk and lectures missed. The only thing I remember about my second year at university is my record-breaking 24-game unbeaten streak against all-comers, using a dastardly negative six-man-midfield Mexico side.
</p><p class="has-image">[body_image width='800' height='600' path='images/content-images/2015/05/22/' crop='images/content-images-crops/2015/05/22/' filename='konamis-iss-and-pro-evo-are-the-football-games-that-defined-my-youth-831-body-image-1432281261.jpg' id='58719']</p><p class="photo-credit">
	A screen shot from 'Pro Evolution Soccer 5.'
</p><p>
	<em>Pro Evo</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro_Evolution_Soccer_2008" target="_blank">debuted for the PlayStation 3</a> in late 2007, almost a full decade after I'd first fallen in love with <em>ISS Pro '98</em>. This was surely set to be Konami's opus. A heritage of addictive, intuitive gameplay coupled with the graphical power of a next-generation console. This was the one I'd been waiting for. And I couldn't have been more disappointed.
</p><p>
	In a rush to get the game ready for the lucrative Christmas market, Konami had released a broken game. The game's engine couldn't cope with the new hardware, matches constantly ground to a halt in a mess of lag and faulty AI. It wasn't as bad as 
	<em>FIFA</em>'s worst efforts of the past, but it wasn't the perfection I'd become accustomed to. I played on, hoping that the kinks would somehow work themselves out, but in my heart I knew it was over. And suddenly I was 21.
</p><p class="has-image">[body_image width='700' height='525' path='images/content-images/2015/05/22/' crop='images/content-images-crops/2015/05/22/' filename='konamis-iss-and-pro-evo-are-the-football-games-that-defined-my-youth-831-body-image-1432281283.jpg' id='58720']</p><p class="photo-credit">
	A (slightly terrifying) screen shot of the player once known as "Ronarid," from 'Pro Evo 2008.'
</p><p>
	I never played a
	<em> Pro Evo</em> title again. I respected the game and my own reverence for it too much to pretend. There is a hardcore group of fans who still passionately support the annual title in the face of FIFA's dominance. Konami has rebuilt the game's engine and appealed to the more fashionable end of the soccer market by acquiring the licenses to the Europa League and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Libertadores" target="_blank">Copa Libertadores</a>, but <em>FIFA</em>'s highly refined gameplay and pristine presentation ensures that <em>Pro Evo</em> will never rule bedrooms and student living rooms like it once did.
</p><p>
	Sometimes I idly browse websites pricing second-hand PlayStation (PSone) consoles or downloadable laptop-based emulators and consider, for a second, reviving my youth with a quick game or ten. But I've always resisted, and I always will—whatever short-term pleasure I might get from a nostalgia kick, the truth is that nothing will compare to the original feeling.
</p><p>
	So I'll stick to the memories I've stored from various stages of my youth—magnolia recollections of waiting for the killer through-pass, lobbing a stranded goalkeeper or securing living room bragging rights by winning a five-goal thriller. And I'm fine with that.</p>

	<a href="http://www.itv.com/news/anglia/update/2015-05-20/pilot-on-dog-drowning-it-was-a-terrible-thing-to-do/" target="_blank">ITV</a> and Google Maps
</p><p>
	<strong>The incident:</strong> A man's neighbor's dog wouldn't stop barking.
</p><p>
	<strong>The appropriate response:</strong> Resolving the issue with the neighbors or the local authorities, depending on the circumstances.
</p><p>
	<strong>The actual response:</strong> He drowned and later mutilated the dog.
</p><p>
	Stephen Woodhouse, a 52-year-old pilot from the village of Long Buckby, England, was mowing his lawn last July, when he grew annoyed by the barking of his neighbor's dog.</p><p>
	Stephen had 
	<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3089612/Flybe-pilot-drowned-neighbour-s-dog-bucket-wouldn-t-stop-barking.html" target="_blank">reportedly</a> had issues with the dog, a border terrier named Meg, in the past, which he claimed he could hear barking from "morning until night."</p><p>
	He leaned over the fence, picked up the dog, and carried her to an area of his property where construction work was being done.
</p><p>
	"There was some building work being done and a big bucket of water," Stephen later told police. "So I stuck it in the bucket until it stopped moving. I never thought of the consequences."
</p><p>
	Once the dog was dead, Stephen hid her body under a hedge.
</p><p>
	Worried that the dog might be tracked by the microchip in her neck, Stephen returned to the body that night and used a knife to cut the chip out.
</p><p>
	When the dog's owners, Alan and Alison Boddington, realized that the dog was missing, they launched a village-wide search operation. They were especially keen to find the dog because they had bought it as a companion for their disabled daughter, who died last year of an asthma attack at the age of ten. Dozens of neighbors and friends joined in the search.
</p><p>
	Eventually, Alison, the dog's owner, grew suspicious that Stephen might have been involved, and searched his car. After finding dog hair and a rope, she called police.
</p><p>
	Stephen 
	<a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/heartless-airline-pilot-drowned-neighbours-5730142" target="_blank">reportedly</a> told police, "I reached my wits' end. All I could think of was that the noise had to stop. It was driving me bloody mad."
</p><p>
	After pleading guilty, he was spared jail, but had to pay £3,200 ($5,000) in fines.
</p><p>
	Stephen has also 
	<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3089612/Flybe-pilot-drowned-neighbour-s-dog-bucket-wouldn-t-stop-barking.html" target="_blank">reportedly</a> been suspended from his job as a pilot pending an investigation to determine whether he is mentally fit to fly.
</p><p>
	One of the villagers who talked to the <em>Daily Mail </em>said, "He hated pets and kids. Nobody likes him... In the entirety of the old village you couldn't find anyone that would say a good word about him."
</p><p>Presumably this incident hasn't done a great deal to help his image. </p><!--recommended--><p class="">

	<strong>The incident: </strong>A woman's boyfriend was snoring.
</p><p>
	<strong>The appropriate response:</strong> Nudging him, then buying him anti-snoring products, then, if that does nothing and it bothers you enough, breaking up with him.
</p><p>
	<strong>The actual response:</strong> She allegedly beat him with a crowbar.
</p><p>
	Last week, Elizabeth Hogrefe (pictured above) was staying at a motel in Lincoln, Nebraska, with her unnamed 58-year-old boyfriend.
</p><p>
	During the night, the boyfriend 
	<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/21/elizabeth-hogrefe_n_7376846.html" target="_blank">allegedly</a> awoke to find Elizabeth yelling at him while beating him with a crowbar.
</p><p>
	According to police, the boyfriend fled the room and staggered down the road. A motorist who saw the injured man reportedly called the police.
</p><p>
	When police found the man at a nearby convenience store, they say they found three large welts on his back that were "consistent with being hit with a pry bar."</p><p>
	A spokesperson for the Lincoln Police Department told the <a href="http://journalstar.com/news/local/911/woman-used-crowbar-to-wake-up-snoring-boyfriend-police-say/article_68b25fbf-f340-530c-bb0b-bf7c50df8fe9.html" target="_blank">Lincoln Journal Star</a> that Elizabeth had attacked the sleeping man because he was snoring.
</p><p>
	Elizabeth was arrested and charged with misdemeanor domestic assault. She is currently in jail awaiting trial—hopefully not in a cell with a snorer.

	<em>Murder #38, Negus McClean, Edmonton, April 10, 2011. Negus McClean, 15, was stabbed to death in Edmonton after being chased by around seven young men riding bicycles and wearing hooded jumpers and face masks. Negus was then beaten with metal poles before being stabbed in the thigh and chest with such force that the blade snapped off in his body. He was found injured in Westminster Road and died after being taken to hospital. Four young men were charged and convicted for his murder.</em>

	<em>This article originally appeared on VICE UK.</em>
</p><p>
	Murders happen everywhere. In homes, in parks, in office buildings, outside the Foot Locker on Oxford Street. However, once the police and forensics teams have been in and out—once the murder has had its mention in the local press—we tend to forget that anything ever happened there. Which is odd, because for a week or two, the meaning of the place changes immeasurably. It becomes the scene of something horrific, something that should taint that place for years. But it rarely does. Time moves on and the place becomes insignificant again, an anonymous building on an anonymous street.
</p><p>
	Mexican-born, London-based photographer 
	<a href="http://www.antonioolmos.com/" target="_blank">Antonio Olmos</a> spent two years documenting these places for his project "The Landscape of Murder." <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Landscape-Murder-Antonio-Zazueta-Olmos/dp/1907893423" target="_blank">He released a book</a> of the same name a couple of years ago, but the work is currently <a href="http://www.richmix.org.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/" target="_blank">getting another airing</a> in the exhibition space at London's Rich Mix cinema. I saw the photos there for the first time last weekend and instantly wanted to talk to Antonio about them, so that's what I did.
</p><!--recommended--><p>
	<strong>VICE: So this project started after the murder of Jitka Nahodilova. Can you tell me about that?<br>
	</strong><strong>Antonio Olmos:</strong> Yeah, I live in a part of London called Arnos Grove, near Arnos Park, and a friend of mine told me there had been a murder near there. I went to look at the house where the murder had happened, and it looked exactly like mine—but there was nothing to show there had been a murder there. Some of the neighbors didn't even know that anything bad had happened.
</p><p>
	I looked in the local papers and there was only a little thing about it. It didn't make it into the national press or anything like that. [Jitka's murder] was a domestic violence case, and later I heard about another domestic violence murder that had happened in Walthamstow, so I started photographing these places, but I didn't really know where I was going with it. After that there was a murder involving teenagers in Walthamstow, and that made the news. I noticed then that there are differences in how things are covered.

	<em>Murder #111, Ruby Love, Southall, December 25, 2011. Ruby Love, 23, was strangled and dumped in the Grand Union Canal on Christmas Day. Her body was spotted by a member of the public in Southall. Love's boyfriend, Manzar Juma, was charged and convicted for her murder. Juma claimed Love had threatened him with a knife and criticized his dead parents. Juma was sentenced to life imprisonment.</em>
</p><p>
	<strong>Yeah, how did you keep track of all these murders if they weren't being covered in the press? <br>
	</strong>I found a website called Murder Map—which is run by this guy Peter Stubley—that covers all the cases going on in London. I started calling him, and I also started looking at the Metropolitan Police website, which tells you what they're doing. And then, over time, I started following certain crime reporters' blogs and tweets, and built up a network of contacts.
</p><p>
	<strong>Who are these contacts? Is there, not a "murder enthusiast" community as such, but individuals who keep on top of this stuff?<br>
	</strong>Not about murder specifically, but there are a bunch of blogs and people writing about gangs, for example. And some of those blogs might occasionally talk about a murder in a more detailed way than the police ever would. There are also domestic violence charities that will tweet about murders. And then there was a guy I was following on Twitter who lives in Shepherd's Bush. Anything that happens in Shepherd's Bush, he tweets about it seconds later—I don't know how he does it. But the biggest things were the Met site and Murder Map.

	<em>Murder #175, Shaun Chambers, Walworth, September 26, 2012. Shaun Chambers. 21, was stabbed to death on the Aylesbury Estate in Walworth. Chambers died soon after arrival at hospital from a stab wound to the heart. Two other young men also suffered stab wounds during the same incident. Ricardo Blake, 16, was charged with murder and two counts of wounding with intent. Blake claimed self defense and was acquitted of both murder and manslaughter, but imprisoned for six years for wounding with intent.</em>
</p><p>
	<strong>Right. Where in London did you find yourself most often? Did it vary throughout the course of the project?<br>
	</strong>Well, obviously Lambeth has a big problem, as does Tottenham. The place I was most surprised by was Croydon—I went there several times, and didn't expect to. When I first came to London I had to go to Croydon to sort out my immigration papers and all that stuff, and I always thought it was a really nice neighborhood. Places like Bexleyheath and Ealing, too—I didn't expect to go there, but went quite a lot.
</p><p>
	<strong>How long would you leave it before going to the scene of the crime?<br>
	</strong>I tried to wait two or three days usually, because if I went straight away I'd always see the same thing—loads of policemen and police cars. And the police would keep people away from the scene, but I wanted to get a little closer. When the initial stuff died down the police would leave, and there might be some forensic people there, but they didn't keep anybody away.

</p><hr><p>
	<strong>So you wanted the scene to settle a bit, basically?<br>
	</strong>Yeah. If I went straight away, it would have been the same photo all the time. I did sometimes go right away, though. There was a murder on Oxford Street, outside Foot Locker, on Boxing Day. I went there the day it happened—I thought it would make an interesting picture with the huge crowd.
</p><p>
	<strong>Yeah. That's a bit of an anomaly in your work, isn't it? The thing that struck me about the majority of the photos was the mundanity of the scene—a street that could be anywhere in London—juxtaposed with the intensity of the crime.<br>
	</strong>Yeah, I knew that I'd be getting a different type of picture there. And yes, most of these other places are kind of anonymous. They're places most of us have never been to, and would never need to go to. There were a few better-known places—there was a murder in King's Cross, one in Farringdon, one in Marble Arch—but other than those, it was mostly places I'd never been to.

	<em>Murder #120, Cheryl Tariah, Barkingside, February 7, 2012. Cheryl Tariah, 17, was found strangled at a flat in Barkingside after police were called to a disturbance above a high street shop. A post-mortem gave the cause of death as compression of the neck. Tariah's boyfriend, Ako Amin, 18, tried to flee the country after the murder but was discovered clinging to the bottom of a truck in Dover three days later. Amin pleaded guilty to the murder and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.</em>

	<strong>Did shooting these photos affect the way you look at London? Knowing that someone was murdered in the house or park you're walking past must change how you see the landscape.<br>
	</strong>I wouldn't say it changed the way I feel about London. I quite like London—I think it's a great city. It's quite a safe city. In terms of the number of murders here, for a city of this size it's still quite small.
</p><p>
	What it has changed is that I know London much better now, and I'm kind of amazed at how huge it is, and how isolated some parts feel. For example, somewhere like New Addington, or even Tottenham, feels really far away from central London. It's just a few miles away, but it feels like another world.
</p><p>
	<strong>Did you shoot the scenes of many murders in the city's wealthier areas?<br>
	</strong>I never went to Kensington or Chelsea, but I did go to Richmond. The first case there was that of a cleaner who'd been murdered, and another was that of a mother who'd been killed by her schizophrenic son. I hardly went to South West London or the West End at all. It was mostly North East and South East London.

</blockquote><p>
	<strong>Why do you think that is? Were many murders a result of youth violence?<br>
	</strong>Well, out of the 210 murders that I shot, I think there were only something like 20 gang-related ones, and maybe another 10 that involved young kids, which weren't really gang-related. The biggest single cause of murder was domestic violence, followed by people with mental health issues, and then some involving drink and drugs. If you listen to the media it seems like all murders in London have something to do with gangs. They get a huge amount of coverage compared to other types of murder, and I don't really know why.
</p><p>
	<strong>Finally, did shooting the project affect your views on death in any way? Did it desensitize you whatsoever?<br>
	</strong>No, no. I never saw any dead bodies—the worst I saw was maybe some blood left on the ground. I think what it has changed is that I was one of these people who... I would walk by things like a memorial and not pay attention, or if I saw an ambulance going somewhere I wouldn't think about what it meant. But now I do. I'm now kind of hyper-aware of London, of where things happen, how things happen.
</p><p>
	I hope I never get desensitized to death. I have two young kids, and since they were born, if I hear about the death of a child, it affects me much more. I think death bothers me a lot more as I get older than compared to when I was young. I don't think I could have done this project if I was desensitized to death, if I was blasé about it. I wanted to be extremely aware of the stuff that goes on around death.
