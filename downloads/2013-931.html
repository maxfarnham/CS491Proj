					"articleBody": "               By Sharon Begley                Jan 21 (Reuters) - A high body count is not the only  meaningful number attached to a pandemic. The potential cost of  a global outbreak of the flu or some other highly contagious  disease, however ghoulish to calculate, is essential for  government officials and business leaders to know. Only by  putting a price tag on such an occurrence can they hope to  establish what containing it is worth.                The financial damage by itself can be devastating. The  expense of major epidemics is evident every time a health agency  totes up the cost of treating infected people - the outlays for  drugs, doctors' visits, and hospitalizations. But that spending  is only the most obvious economic impact of an outbreak.                Consider the effect on international airlines. During the  2003 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which began in  southern China and lasted about seven months, business and  leisure travelers drastically cut back on flying. Asia-Pacific  carriers saw revenue plunge $6 billion and North American  airlines lost another $1 billion.                The tourism industry also took a beating. The net revenue of  Park Place Entertainment, owner of Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas  and other gambling and hotel complexes, plunged more than 50  percent in the second quarter of 2003 compared with the year  before, mainly because Asian high rollers hunkered down rather  than risk infection while traveling.                Fear even hurt businesses dependent on sales calls. AIG,  which pulled almost 30 percent of its revenue from Asia back  then, was hobbled when the epidemic kept its agents from  visiting potential customers.                That's just the easily measured stuff; the indirect costs  pushed the total SARS bill much higher. &quot;The biggest driver of  the economics of pandemics is not mortality or morbidity but  risk aversion, as people change their behavior to reduce their  chance of exposure,&quot; says Dr. Dennis Carroll, director of the  U.S. Agency for International Development's programs on new and  emerging disease threats. &quot;People don't go to their jobs, and  they don't go to shopping malls. There can be a huge decrease in  consumer demand, and if (a pandemic) continues long enough, it  can affect manufacturing&quot; as producers cut output to align  supply with lower demand. If schools are closed, healthy workers  may have to stay home with their children. People afraid of  becoming infected are less likely to go out to stores,  restaurants or movies.                Most of China was essentially on lockdown in the first half  of 2003 as the government did everything in its considerable  power to minimize human-to-human contact and, hence, the spread  of SARS. Beijing was shut down tighter than at any time since  martial law was declared during the 1989 Tiananmen Square  protests. Discos, bars, shopping malls, indoor sports  facilities, and movie theaters were closed, and 80 percent of  the capital's five-star hotel rooms were vacant.                By May 2003, Singapore Airlines had cut capacity 71 percent  and put its 6,600-member flight staff on unpaid leave. Tourism  to Singapore fell 70 percent, and the country's gross domestic  product took a $400 million hit that year.                From Asia, where the disease was largely confined, the  ripples spread in all directions. Toronto recorded 361 SARS  cases and 33 deaths, and the World Health Organization issued an  advisory against traveling there - surely a factor in the $5  billion loss Canada's GDP suffered in 2003.                It's not surprising that a pandemic hurts businesses  dependent on employees or customers moving from point a to point  b (as AIG and the airlines learned), but SARS also set back  transport companies such as FedEx (closed airports; fewer people  doing business), telecom equipment-makers such as Nortel  (vendors and customers staying home) and cable-TV-box maker  Scientific-Atlanta (multiple parts made in Asia). It even cut  deeply into profits for Estee Lauder, which under normal  circumstances sells a lot of cosmetics in Hong Kong, Singapore  and China, and in duty-free airport shops.                In our interconnected world, a farmer running a fever in  Southern China can reduce the income of a baggage handler in  Frankfurt, and hence all the businesses that worker patronizes.  &quot;Within hours or days, an event that starts on one side of the  world can establish itself on the other,&quot; says Carroll.  Lufthansa saw demand for flights to and from the Far East tumble  85 percent that year, and grounded a dozen planes. With planes  grounded, oil demand fell by 300,000 barrels a day in Asia,  dinging the revenues of oil companies from Kuwait to Venezuela.     A COST BEYOND MEASURE?  The World Bank estimated China's SARS-related losses at $14.8  billion, and although the United States and Europe were largely  spared its ravages, the pandemic reduced the global GDP by $33  billion. And here's a scary thought: As health crises go, SARS  wasn't that bad: It killed just 916 people and lasted well under  a year. The Department of Health &amp; Human Services estimates that  the ho-hum seasonal flu is responsible for 111 million lost  workdays each year in the United States. That's $7 billion in  sick days and lost productivity.                A global pandemic that lasted a year could trigger a &quot;major  global recession,&quot; warned a 2008 report from the World Bank. If  a pandemic were on the scale of the Hong Kong flu of 1968-69 in  its transmissibility and severity, a yearlong outbreak could  cause world GDP to fall 0.7 percent. If we get hit with  something like the 1957 Asian flu, say goodbye to 2 percent of  GDP. Something as bad as the 1918-19 Spanish flu would cut the  world's economic output by 4.8 percent and cost more than $3  trillion. &quot;Generally speaking,&quot; the report added, &quot;developing  countries would be hardest hit, because higher population  densities and poverty accentuate the economic impacts.&quot;                The majority of the economic losses would come not from  sickness or death but from what the World Bank calls &quot;efforts to  avoid infection: reducing air travel  avoiding travel to  infected destinations, and reducing consumption of services such  as restaurant dining, tourism, mass transport, and nonessential  retail shopping.&quot;                The really bad news is that we may not be hearing all the  bad news. Economists who study pandemics worry they may be  underestimating the financial toll because they haven't been  considering all the ramifications. &quot;Research to understand the  indirect costs of an epidemic has been growing, focusing on how  to accurately incorporate productivity losses and effects on  economic activity,&quot; says Bruce Lee of the University of  Pittsburgh Medical Center, where he is an associate professor,  director of the Public Health Computational and Operations  Research Group, and an expert in the economics of infectious  diseases.                Take workplace vaccination. Public health officials  recommend it, but does it help the bottom line? Would targeted  shots bring a higher return on investment? Should employers  vaccinate only their older employees? Or just those, say, in the  shipping department? Lee and colleagues found that for the 22  main occupations defined by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  (legal, management, food preparation, education, and 18 more),  when the employer footed the bill, &quot;employee vaccination was  cost-saving for the median wage&quot; if contagion was on the low  side (one case producing 0.2 to 0.6 additional cases). It was  almost cost-neutral for low-paid occupations, and a clear  benefit for high-paid ones. The biggest payoff is for older  workers, since they are more likely to become ill and miss work  if infected. As a result, &quot;employers could gain money&quot; by  underwriting flu shots, Lee says, adding that &quot;a flu virus does  not have to hospitalize or kill a lot of people to have a large  effect on society.&quot;                Analyses of epidemic-related school closings can also inform  policy. In 2009, as the H1N1 influenza (swine flu) epidemic  gathered force, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) as well as state and local public health  officials considered closing schools in order to reduce  transmission of the virus. Taiwan did so, closing schools for  one week.                Lee and colleagues analyzed what closing schools in  Pennsylvania would cost. Reducing transmission of a virus saves  healthcare expenditures, not surprisingly, and averts deaths.  &quot;But closing a school has a lot of ripple effects,&quot; Lee says.  &quot;You not only have teachers and staff not working, and having to  make up the lost time in July, but parents have to stay home  with their kids.&quot; Bottom line: It would cost as much as $51,000  to avert a single case of a very transmissible flu. As a result  of the Taiwan school closings for SARS, one study found, 27  percent of households reported workplace absenteeism and 18  percent suffered an average wage loss of five days' pay.                A 2009 study by economists at the Brookings Institution  analyzed the direct economic impact of closing schools during a  flu pandemic. Since about one-quarter of civilian workers in the  United States have a child under 16 and no stay-at-home adult,  closing all the nation's K-12 schools for two weeks would result  in between $5.2 billion and $23.6 billion in lost economic  activity; a four-week closing would cost up to $47.1 billion  dollars - 0.3 percent of GDP.                &quot;Those are only the first-order effects,&quot; says Ross Hammond,  who led the Brookings study. &quot;There are also multiplier effects  from a multibillion-dollar decline in economic output.&quot; He  looked only at lost wages, but people whose income falls because  they don't work for several weeks don't spend as much, and the  people who don't receive that spending cut their own in turn. In  addition, he said, &quot;The decrease in supply of some goods as  factories run at less than full capacity might lead to  inflation.&quot;                Also tricky is deciding how to account for outbreak-related  spending. For instance, Hong Kong spent $1.5 billion on a &quot;We  love HK&quot; campaign to get residents out of their homes, facemasks  in place. Note that such economic activity counts toward GDP.  Similarly, hospital charges, doctors' fees, medication, and  other epidemic-related costs add to GDP.    HOW MUCH THAT IS LOST IS MADE UP?  It may seem heartless to count such spending as an economic  plus, on a par with welcoming an earthquake for the construction  boom it triggers, but a dollar spent on medicine still  contributes to a company's bottom line and to the GDP. In fact,  analysts do a robust business figuring out how investors can  profit from an epidemic. Sales of vaccines and drugs to combat  H1N1 (swine flu) in 2009 boosted some pharmaceutical companies.  By early 2010, when the mild epidemic had petered out,  Sanofi-Aventis had registered net profits of $10.1 billion, up  11 percent year-to-year.                Wall Street never encountered a disaster it couldn't profit  from, and pandemics are no exception. Several companies have  produced investor guides to avian flu. In the event of an  outbreak, Citigroup concluded in a 2005 report, investors should  short companies whose revenues come from malls, casinos, air  travel, and tourism. Analysts were also bearish on  labor-intensive industries and countries with &quot;inflexible&quot; labor  laws (most of Europe) because companies cannot easily fire  workers if demand for their products falls off a cliff.                In contrast, Citi says avian flu will not only benefit  healthcare companies but also those that provide products and  services people turn to when they're afraid to leave home:  telecoms, Internet commerce companies, home entertainment and  even utilities. Finally, because any worldwide calamity sends  currency traders scurrying for safe havens, Citi expects the  dollar to rise in the event of a pandemic. Overall, it  concluded, &quot;We would expect global economic activity to decline,  raw material prices to collapse, risk aversion to rise, monetary  policy to ease, and interest rates to fall.&quot;                Economists acknowledge that there are still plenty of  unknowns here. For one thing, they're not sure how much of the  economic activity lost is eventually made up. Another unknown is  the effect on factory production. Illness and fear keep most  people home during a pandemic, but not in China. During SARS,  employees were quarantined to inhibit contagion, yet because  many of them lived in company-owned dormitories, they continued  to work, and their employers built up enormous inventories.                The greatest unknowns are such macroeconomic effects as  interest rates and inflation. Some analyses suggest that when  production is scaled back, the shortage of goods creates  inflationary pressures. That might not occur if the supply  cutback were met by a fall in demand as people shopped less.                Researchers are making progress on these fronts, but it  hasn't been easy. &quot;When we economists first came to CDC in 1995,  many people told us it was immoral to include economic analyses  in questions of public health,&quot; says health economist Martin  Meltzer. &quot;But taxpayers have a right to know, if they're putting  x dollars on the table (for vaccinations, quarantines or other  flu-fighting measures): What are they getting?&quot;                Until all those questions are answered, savvy investors  won't be putting money on the table to cash in on the next  global pandemic. But as surely as a devastating swine flu  epidemic is coming, some shrewd, and perhaps soulless, quants  wizard will figure out how to profit from it.

        <p>               <br>By Sharon Begley</br>                <br>Jan 21 (Reuters) - A high body count is not the only  meaningful number attached to a pandemic. The potential cost of  a global outbreak of the flu or some other highly contagious  disease, however ghoulish to calculate, is essential for  government officials and business leaders to know. Only by  putting a price tag on such an occurrence can they hope to  establish what containing it is worth.</br>                <br>The financial damage by itself can be devastating. The  expense of major epidemics is evident every time a health agency  totes up the cost of treating infected people - the outlays for  drugs, doctors' visits, and hospitalizations. But that spending  is only the most obvious economic impact of an outbreak.</br>                <br>Consider the effect on international airlines. During the  2003 SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which began in  southern China and lasted about seven months, business and  leisure travelers drastically cut back on flying. Asia-Pacific  carriers saw revenue plunge $6 billion and North American  airlines lost another $1 billion.</br>                <br>The tourism industry also took a beating. The net revenue of  Park Place Entertainment, owner of Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas  and other gambling and hotel complexes, plunged more than 50  percent in the second quarter of 2003 compared with the year  before, mainly because Asian high rollers hunkered down rather  than risk infection while traveling.</br>                <br>Fear even hurt businesses dependent on sales calls. AIG,  which pulled almost 30 percent of its revenue from Asia back  then, was hobbled when the epidemic kept its agents from  visiting potential customers.</br>                <br>That's just the easily measured stuff; the indirect costs  pushed the total SARS bill much higher. "The biggest driver of  the economics of pandemics is not mortality or morbidity but  risk aversion, as people change their behavior to reduce their  chance of exposure," says Dr. Dennis Carroll, director of the  U.S. Agency for International Development's programs on new and  emerging disease threats. "People don't go to their jobs, and  they don't go to shopping malls. There can be a huge decrease in  consumer demand, and if (a pandemic) continues long enough, it  can affect manufacturing" as producers cut output to align  supply with lower demand. If schools are closed, healthy workers  may have to stay home with their children. People afraid of  becoming infected are less likely to go out to stores,  restaurants or movies.</br>                <br>Most of China was essentially on lockdown in the first half  of 2003 as the government did everything in its considerable  power to minimize human-to-human contact and, hence, the spread  of SARS. Beijing was shut down tighter than at any time since  martial law was declared during the 1989 Tiananmen Square  protests. Discos, bars, shopping malls, indoor sports  facilities, and movie theaters were closed, and 80 percent of  the capital's five-star hotel rooms were vacant.</br>                <br>By May 2003, Singapore Airlines had cut capacity 71 percent  and put its 6,600-member flight staff on unpaid leave. Tourism  to Singapore fell 70 percent, and the country's gross domestic  product took a $400 million hit that year.</br>                <br>From Asia, where the disease was largely confined, the  ripples spread in all directions. Toronto recorded 361 SARS  cases and 33 deaths, and the World Health Organization issued an  advisory against traveling there - surely a factor in the $5  billion loss Canada's GDP suffered in 2003.</br>                <br>It's not surprising that a pandemic hurts businesses  dependent on employees or customers moving from point a to point  b (as AIG and the airlines learned), but SARS also set back  transport companies such as FedEx (closed airports; fewer people  doing business), telecom equipment-makers such as Nortel  (vendors and customers staying home) and cable-TV-box maker  Scientific-Atlanta (multiple parts made in Asia). It even cut  deeply into profits for Estee Lauder, which under normal  circumstances sells a lot of cosmetics in Hong Kong, Singapore  and China, and in duty-free airport shops.</br>                <br>In our interconnected world, a farmer running a fever in  Southern China can reduce the income of a baggage handler in  Frankfurt, and hence all the businesses that worker patronizes.  "Within hours or days, an event that starts on one side of the  world can establish itself on the other," says Carroll.  Lufthansa saw demand for flights to and from the Far East tumble  85 percent that year, and grounded a dozen planes. With planes  grounded, oil demand fell by 300,000 barrels a day in Asia,  dinging the revenues of oil companies from Kuwait to Venezuela.     A COST BEYOND MEASURE?  The World Bank estimated China's SARS-related losses at $14.8  billion, and although the United States and Europe were largely  spared its ravages, the pandemic reduced the global GDP by $33  billion. And here's a scary thought: As health crises go, SARS  wasn't that bad: It killed just 916 people and lasted well under  a year. The Department of Health & Human Services estimates that  the ho-hum seasonal flu is responsible for 111 million lost  workdays each year in the United States. That's $7 billion in  sick days and lost productivity.</br>                <br>A global pandemic that lasted a year could trigger a "major  global recession," warned a 2008 report from the World Bank. If  a pandemic were on the scale of the Hong Kong flu of 1968-69 in  its transmissibility and severity, a yearlong outbreak could  cause world GDP to fall 0.7 percent. If we get hit with  something like the 1957 Asian flu, say goodbye to 2 percent of  GDP. Something as bad as the 1918-19 Spanish flu would cut the  world's economic output by 4.8 percent and cost more than $3  trillion. "Generally speaking," the report added, "developing  countries would be hardest hit, because higher population  densities and poverty accentuate the economic impacts."</br>                <br>The majority of the economic losses would come not from  sickness or death but from what the World Bank calls "efforts to  avoid infection: reducing air travel  avoiding travel to  infected destinations, and reducing consumption of services such  as restaurant dining, tourism, mass transport, and nonessential  retail shopping."</br>                <br>The really bad news is that we may not be hearing all the  bad news. Economists who study pandemics worry they may be  underestimating the financial toll because they haven't been  considering all the ramifications. "Research to understand the  indirect costs of an epidemic has been growing, focusing on how  to accurately incorporate productivity losses and effects on  economic activity," says Bruce Lee of the University of  Pittsburgh Medical Center, where he is an associate professor,  director of the Public Health Computational and Operations  Research Group, and an expert in the economics of infectious  diseases.</br>                <br>Take workplace vaccination. Public health officials  recommend it, but does it help the bottom line? Would targeted  shots bring a higher return on investment? Should employers  vaccinate only their older employees? Or just those, say, in the  shipping department? Lee and colleagues found that for the 22  main occupations defined by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics  (legal, management, food preparation, education, and 18 more),  when the employer footed the bill, "employee vaccination was  cost-saving for the median wage" if contagion was on the low  side (one case producing 0.2 to 0.6 additional cases). It was  almost cost-neutral for low-paid occupations, and a clear  benefit for high-paid ones. The biggest payoff is for older  workers, since they are more likely to become ill and miss work  if infected. As a result, "employers could gain money" by  underwriting flu shots, Lee says, adding that "a flu virus does  not have to hospitalize or kill a lot of people to have a large  effect on society."</br>                <br>Analyses of epidemic-related school closings can also inform  policy. In 2009, as the H1N1 influenza (swine flu) epidemic  gathered force, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) as well as state and local public health  officials considered closing schools in order to reduce  transmission of the virus. Taiwan did so, closing schools for  one week.</br>                <br>Lee and colleagues analyzed what closing schools in  Pennsylvania would cost. Reducing transmission of a virus saves  healthcare expenditures, not surprisingly, and averts deaths.  "But closing a school has a lot of ripple effects," Lee says.  "You not only have teachers and staff not working, and having to  make up the lost time in July, but parents have to stay home  with their kids." Bottom line: It would cost as much as $51,000  to avert a single case of a very transmissible flu. As a result  of the Taiwan school closings for SARS, one study found, 27  percent of households reported workplace absenteeism and 18  percent suffered an average wage loss of five days' pay.</br>                <br>A 2009 study by economists at the Brookings Institution  analyzed the direct economic impact of closing schools during a  flu pandemic. Since about one-quarter of civilian workers in the  United States have a child under 16 and no stay-at-home adult,  closing all the nation's K-12 schools for two weeks would result  in between $5.2 billion and $23.6 billion in lost economic  activity; a four-week closing would cost up to $47.1 billion  dollars - 0.3 percent of GDP.</br>                <br>"Those are only the first-order effects," says Ross Hammond,  who led the Brookings study. "There are also multiplier effects  from a multibillion-dollar decline in economic output." He  looked only at lost wages, but people whose income falls because  they don't work for several weeks don't spend as much, and the  people who don't receive that spending cut their own in turn. In  addition, he said, "The decrease in supply of some goods as  factories run at less than full capacity might lead to  inflation."</br>                <br>Also tricky is deciding how to account for outbreak-related  spending. For instance, Hong Kong spent $1.5 billion on a "We  love HK" campaign to get residents out of their homes, facemasks  in place. Note that such economic activity counts toward GDP.  Similarly, hospital charges, doctors' fees, medication, and  other epidemic-related costs add to GDP.    HOW MUCH THAT IS LOST IS MADE UP?  It may seem heartless to count such spending as an economic  plus, on a par with welcoming an earthquake for the construction  boom it triggers, but a dollar spent on medicine still  contributes to a company's bottom line and to the GDP. In fact,  analysts do a robust business figuring out how investors can  profit from an epidemic. Sales of vaccines and drugs to combat  H1N1 (swine flu) in 2009 boosted some pharmaceutical companies.  By early 2010, when the mild epidemic had petered out,  Sanofi-Aventis had registered net profits of $10.1 billion, up  11 percent year-to-year.</br>                <br>Wall Street never encountered a disaster it couldn't profit  from, and pandemics are no exception. Several companies have  produced investor guides to avian flu. In the event of an  outbreak, Citigroup concluded in a 2005 report, investors should  short companies whose revenues come from malls, casinos, air  travel, and tourism. Analysts were also bearish on  labor-intensive industries and countries with "inflexible" labor  laws (most of Europe) because companies cannot easily fire  workers if demand for their products falls off a cliff.</br>                <br>In contrast, Citi says avian flu will not only benefit  healthcare companies but also those that provide products and  services people turn to when they're afraid to leave home:  telecoms, Internet commerce companies, home entertainment and  even utilities. Finally, because any worldwide calamity sends  currency traders scurrying for safe havens, Citi expects the  dollar to rise in the event of a pandemic. Overall, it  concluded, "We would expect global economic activity to decline,  raw material prices to collapse, risk aversion to rise, monetary  policy to ease, and interest rates to fall."</br>                <br>Economists acknowledge that there are still plenty of  unknowns here. For one thing, they're not sure how much of the  economic activity lost is eventually made up. Another unknown is  the effect on factory production. Illness and fear keep most  people home during a pandemic, but not in China. During SARS,  employees were quarantined to inhibit contagion, yet because  many of them lived in company-owned dormitories, they continued  to work, and their employers built up enormous inventories.</br>                <br>The greatest unknowns are such macroeconomic effects as  interest rates and inflation. Some analyses suggest that when  production is scaled back, the shortage of goods creates  inflationary pressures. That might not occur if the supply  cutback were met by a fall in demand as people shopped less.</br>                <br>Researchers are making progress on these fronts, but it  hasn't been easy. "When we economists first came to CDC in 1995,  many people told us it was immoral to include economic analyses  in questions of public health," says health economist Martin  Meltzer. "But taxpayers have a right to know, if they're putting  x dollars on the table (for vaccinations, quarantines or other  flu-fighting measures): What are they getting?"</br>                <br>Until all those questions are answered, savvy investors  won't be putting money on the table to cash in on the next  global pandemic. But as surely as a devastating swine flu  epidemic is coming, some shrewd, and perhaps soulless, quants  wizard will figure out how to profit from it.

						<p style="display: none;">If you're feeling well enough to watch a movie, make it a comedy. Research shows that laughing may actually boost your immune system. </p>
					</li>

						<p style="display: none;">Turn your bathroom into a steam room by running a hot shower. If you're too lightheaded to stand, sit on a chair or the closed toilet and breathe in the steam, which moistens your nasal passages and throat, and can help you relax. </p>

						<p style="display: none;">If you make winter's classic warm drink at home, you control what goes into the mix. That can keep sugar in check with unsweetened cocoa powder and cut back on fat by using skim milk -- plus you can still reap the health benefits of chocolate, like a boost in heart health, a drop in blood pressure and lifted spirits.

And if you're suffering from a flu or cold virus, the added hydration boost can only help your body's capacity for fighting the infection.

						<p style="display: none;">Sipping soup, especially broth, is bound to feel good, while providing you with the nutrients you need to fight your infection. It's also an easy way to  eat healthfully  without feeling weighed down. And homemade beats canned soups or restaurant servings, which are often loaded with sodium. 

Making your own hearty meal in a bowl cuts back on salt and also gives you the chance to load it up with healthy winter veggies. Try these tasty winter soup recipes from HuffPost Wellness Editor Dr. Patricia Fitzgerald.</p>

						<p style="display: none;">Just as you want to keep your body active when you're stuck indoors, exercising your gray matter is a great idea, too. Depending on the objective, board games can test your powers of memory, logic and problem solving. 

So dust off that old Scrabble board, serve up the hot chocolate and challenge a friend or family member to a round. Don't already own any games? Many can be easily downloaded as smartphone or tablet apps.</p>

						<p style="display: none;">Sleep, sleep, sleep. We probably don't even have to tell you to this one, as you're bound to be feeling wiped out. But try to support your sleep schedule by timing caffeine intake (from coffee, tea or even medications) so that it doesn't interfere with your naps.</p>

						<p style="display: none;">If you find yourself repeatedly wishing for more hours in the day, take some time to kick back and relax. Being out sick is the perfect excuse to stay away from your email and phone. What's more, the CDC recommends avoiding contact with the people around you when you're contagious. </p>
