The 2016 Lincoln MKX comes with a swanky, custom designed sound system. Lincoln a terrible place to listen to music. There’s all that background noise from the engine, the tires, the wind. The interior is designed for comfort and safety, not optimal sound. There are hard surfaces, which reflect sound, and soft surfaces, which absorb it. You can get fantastic sound in a car, but it takes a lot of time, careful thought and money. It’s easier for automakers to justify spending those three things designing audio systems for luxury cars, where buyers are more discerning and it can be harder to stand out in the market. Offering a killer sound system is one more way to attract buyers. The high end model comes with 19 speakers. Lincoln Which is why Lincoln, struggling to regain market share lost to the Germans decades ago, teamed up with Revel, the high-end arm of Harman, to bring some level of audiophile musicality to the MKX crossover. Ford’s luxury arm is the latest in a long line of brands teaming up with audio companies. Mercedes and Audi work with Bang Olufsen, Lexus has Mark Levinson, Infiniti’s paired with Bose. Any introduction of a luxury car these days lists the sound system right up there with horsepower, active safety features, and what kind of wood and leather fill the interior. It’s more than slapping high-quality speakers into a fancy car. For Lincoln, getting it right meant inviting Revel into the design studio from the start. “I was allowed to be there in the clay model studio, and make sure that things that are really important for audio, that auto manufacturers are unaware of, were taken care of properly,” says Kevin Voecks, product development manager at Harman. That meant things like including relatively large sealed enclosures for the midbass drivers and subwoofers, and tweaking the design of the doors to suit the system. By Voecks’ account, Lincoln obliged. “They put up with all of that attention to detail.” Revel engineers paid attention to tiny details like the design of the speaker grille and how it affects sound coming out. Lincoln The advantage to working with a car interior—especially one whose shape you can influence—is that at least you know what kind of space you’re dealing with, unlike a home system that can be plopped down in any kind of room. “We know exactly what the cabin is like, and do all of the design work with that specific cabin,” Voecks says. You can do all your testing in the car itself, even taking it to the track to see how your calculations match real world sound. Revel started off by making custom transducers (speakers, basically). It determined the top-shelf version of its system would use 19 of them; the second tier would offer 12. Once the setup was settled, the engineers started the tuning process. They began without road noise, then added complications as they went along. It’s helpful, Voecks says, that the MKX is designed for quiet, but vibrations still make us perceive less bass. So the team tuned the equalizer to increase the bass as speed increases. The specifics for that are set using real world testing on a track. But not every Lincoln MKX will be the same: Customers will have choices of various trims. Change the materials, change the sound. So Revel factors that in. If a buyer goes for the headliner that absorbs sound waves, he gets a system tuned to account for it. Different speakers get different grilles, based on their sound wavelength. The specificity required to make the system sound as good as possible in a variety of situations—what kind of leather is used? where’s the door handle placed?—comes from thousands of hours of testing, Voecks says, on the part of engineers at Revel and Lincoln. The goal, of course, is to make the sound as perfect as possible. But, Lincoln’s Carey White says, it’s not just for audiophiles. Aural noobs may not be able to exactly describe distortion, but they can still hear it and dislike it. So the Revel system reduces it to below the level of audibility. The next time Revel whips up a custom system, the work on the MKX won’t save its engineers any time. “When it’s a different cabin, it’s a new game,” Voecks says. “It’s almost from scratch again.” Look, It’s Really Hard to Land a Rocket on a Boat, OK?
