The Five Elements are Metal, Water, Wood, Fire and Earth. The twelve animal are Rat,
Cow, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep, Monkey, Chicken, Dog and Pig.
Year of 2015 is Wooden Sheep. Because Wood (tree) is connected to the color of
Green.

<p>We don't want to use Chinese animal sign from the birth year to 
predict
people's fortune here. We are going to use a much more accurate method 
by
using techniques from Chinese Professional fortunetellers to do a 2015 
prediction. The method is from the theory of Yin-Yang Five Elements to 
predict
people's fortune. The philosophy of Yin-Yang is the Balance. Traditional
 Chinese Astrology
is a discussion about the balance of Five Elements. Each animal sign 
contains
different Five Elements inside. So every animal sign can be converted
into Five Elements. You can find your animal signs, Five Element weights
 and the
astrological birth chart from our <a href="http://www.mastertsai.com/ChineseAstrology/Chineseastrology.htm" target="_blank">Chinese
Astrology</a> page.</p>
<p>
Before predicting your fortune regarding to your money, career, marriage or
health in 2015, you have to know what <b>Type of Element</b> you are and what
your <b><a href="http://www.mastertsai.com/ChineseAstrology/Chineseastrology.htm" target="_blank"><font color="#FF0080">Lucky Element</font></a></b> is from your
Astrology Birth Chart. The <a href="http://www.mastertsai.com/ChineseAstrology/Chineseastrology.htm" target="_blank">Lucky Element</a> is the major
factor to determine people's fortune. 2015 is the Year of the Green Wooden Sheep, which contains
Earth, Fire
and Wood. If your Lucky Element is
Wood, Fire or Earth, then 2015 will bring you some degree of fortune. The
strongest element of 2015 is Earth. Therefore, people whose lucky element is
Earth
will get most benefits in 2015. The element of Wood is also shown strong in
2015. People whose lucky element is Wood will have a nice Green Wooden Sheep
year, too.</p>
<p>
For details and an accurate predictions, the first step to know your fortune is
to know
which elements and animals are in your birth chart. You can find that information from the <b>
<a href="http://www.mastertsai.com/ChineseAstrology/Chineseastrology.htm" target="_blank">Chinese Astrology Lucky Element</a></b> page

<p>
This person was born on June 15, 2008 or June 30, 1948. The symbol of the upper row of the Day
Column (a.k.a. <b>Day Master</b>) represents the person. So we can say <u>Day
Master is <b>Male Fire</b></u>, which represents this person. The birth chart
has too little Metal and needs more Metal to balance the Five Elements. Therefore,
the <u>Lucky Element is Metal</u>.</p>
<p>
2015 is Female Wooden Sheep year. Sheep contains Earth, Fire and Wood. Wood
helps Fire to burn into Earth (dust). This is a year of strong Earth and Fire.
This birth chart already has too much Fire and Earth, which make the birth chart
even more imbalanced. It's is pretty bad sign. The extremely stronger Fire lets
this short-tempered person become even more hot-tempered. The irritating
personality will likely bring very poor and hostile feelings in relationships
with friends and siblings. Furthermore, possible bad investment, money loss
and&nbsp;financial problems may come after. </p>
<p>
Water is weak in the birth chart. Water
becomes very unfavorable when strong Earth and Fire are around. Water is related to
career. The strong Earth helps this person to explode bad temper quickly without
fear. This will create enemy at work. This is bad sign for the career luck.</p>
<p>
Wood also comes in 2015. Wood doesn't help this person at all. The is because
Wood is the mother element of Fire. Wood will make Fire stronger. Fire is the
unlucky element. That implies parents or supporters lead this person to a wrong
direction.</p>

<a href="http://www.chinesefortunecalendar.com/2013ChineseHoroscope.htm" style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue">2013
was the Year of Snake</a>. Snake is the first year of the Fire cycle
before Horse.
The Fire of Snake is heat from the rising sun reaching to the top of sky.
<a style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue" href="http://www.chinesefortunecalendar.com/2014ChineseHoroscope.htm">2014
is the Year of Horse</a>. The Fire of Horse is the heat from ground which absorbs heat from the sun on the top
of the sky. 2015 is the Year of Sheep. Sheep is the last year of the Fire cycle
after Horse. The Fire of Sheep is the heat maintaining in the ground. This heat
can help fruit of tree becoming ripe. If you are working hard over the past two
years, then 2015 is the year to see the result. Basically, if you do great
in 2014 because of Fire, then your fortune will continue and 2015 is the year to
review your achievement. If you had trouble for past years, 2015 is the turning
point year for you. Sheep contains Female Earth, which can help people to create
something from nothing, Therefore, anyone wants an outstanding performance in
2015, then he needs to find a new approach to reach the goal.</p>
<p>
2015 is Female Wood Sheep Year. The Female Wood is connected to grass, leaves of
vegetables, vine, sprout, low bushes and scrub, which need sunshine, earth and
water to grow their leaves or branches. Sheep contains fire, earth and wood. So
Sheep can help Female Wood becoming stronger. That implies you will do well in
2015, if your

Metal, which is a good news. Metal and Wood of 2015 are opposite 
elements; they have fighting
relationship. That means 2015 is mixing good and bad year.
<p>However, if there is a Male
Metal in the Birth Chart or 10-year Major Cycle, then Male Metal and
Female Wood of 2015 have attraction relationship into Metal. In this case, 2015
becomes a pretty good year. Conversely, If there is no Male Metal in the birth
chart,
then Metal becomes weak. Metal cannot provide too much help for you in 2015.
Also, in this case, you
need to pay attention on your
respiratory system, because Metal is connected to lungs.</p>

 have strong Metal in your birth chart, then you will have
very good money luck. This is because you had known how to mange

then Day Master and Wood of 2015 have attraction relationship into Metal.
That means money and related events will automatically come toward you in
2015. It will bring you either money fortune or money loss.<p>Sheep of 2015 contains
Earth, which related to your parents, elders, education, knowledge, or health.
Therefore, you will spend some time to connect with your parents and elders.
Or you
might focus on education to expand your knowledge and skills. Also, you might
watch your health more often. Earth is the mother element of Metal. 2015 will
bring you more energy, safety, protection, and give you better health and stronger determination.</p>
<p>Sheep is the final year of Fire cycle, after Snake and Horse. Therefore,
Sheep also contains some Fire. Metal is afraid of Fire, which represents
pressure, job, boss, teacher, career, trouble or law to Day Master. If you were
doing well in your career over the past two years, then your career luck will
continue. If you had trouble in your career in 2013 and 2014, then the job
pressure will be still there, but it will alleviate. After summer, your career luck will turn to
a better direction.</p>
<p>Besides Earth and Fire, Sheep also contains Wood. Wood can help Fire to
burn. Fire can burn Wood into dust (Earth). That means Earth is stronger
than Wood and Fire. Earth is the mother element of
Metal. Earth can give all
energy and support to the Metal. Wood represents money and Fire represents
career. In 2015, Money and Career events are active. Earth can handle all
the troubles from money and career for you.</p>
<p>If you have weak Metal in the birth
chart, then everything - support, money, career and reputation will come
your way in 2015. If you own the business, then your business will continue
to grow under your expectation. If you work for someone with weak Metal,
then you will find that daily job becomes must easier and project schedules will
be
well-controlled in 2015.</p>
<p>But what if you have strong Metal? Firstly, you have very good money
income. But you will have stronger personality. You will become
over-confident, even some arrogant, which will hurt your reputation. Then
you might have poor money investment. So money comes, then money goes to the
other end quietly.</p>

law. If you have strong Water in your birth chart, then both of your money
and career luck will be great in 2015. If Water is too weak in your birth

<u><b><font color="#FF0080" size="3">When You (Day Master) are Wood</font></b></u></p>2015
 is Wooden Sheep year. Sheep contains Earth, but also contains some
Wood. Wood comes little bit strong. Wood of 2015 represents your 
friends, siblings, or same generation
relatives.
Basically the relationships with them are same to year 2014. You will 
spend some of your time with them in 2015. If your Wood is weak in
the birth chart, then 2015 will be good year to you because your friends
 or
relatives will be around to help you whenever you need. They 
will&nbsp;provide good advice, which
can make your job easier and bring your money
investment luckier.
<p>If your Wood is strong in the birth chart, then your relatives or friends
will bring money trouble to you. It's not a smart move to have any risky
investments with them or provide them with a short-term loan. However, we
sometimes have to spend money to help someone we love for their health,
education, business, career or special issues. All these might happen in 2015.</p>
<p>The main element of Sheep is Earth. Earth represents your money, finance
or wealth. Sheep also contains Fire, which stands for your reputation. If
you earn good reputation from people, then your income will crease because
of your reputation. Basically, the money opportunity is all around you, but
they are not obvious out there. You need to dig them out as early as you
can. Otherwise, you friends might find them before you.</p>
<p>Wood people will spend most of time to deal with friends and
money in 2015. If you have good people relationship, then that friendship
will help you to bring in great money and decent wealth. But if
your social connection is poor, then you don't have to expect good luck in
money.</p>
<p>Earth of 2015 is also connected to girlfriend or wife for a man. If you
are male, then your love possibilities or love relationship will improve.
However, those opportunities and relationships are full of competition. You
need to take aggressive action to win woman's heart.</p>
