        Ask Google to dial phone numbers by voice by saying phrases like "Call Jordan". If you have
        multiple contacts named "Jordan", Google will ask you to specify which one. Reply by saying
        the full name, or something intuitive like "the first one".
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also set up nicknames for family, friends, and others, such as "Call my sister" or
        "Call my boss". The first time you use a nickname, Google will ask you which number you
        want to associate with it - simply follow the prompts on screen.

        Start a voice search on Android in two ways. You can tap the microphone icon in the Google

        voice search.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, make sure you have the latest version of the Google app, then open it. In the top
        left corner, touch the following: Menu icon &gt; Settings &gt; Voice &gt; "Ok Google"
        detection. Make sure "From the Google app" and "Always on" are switched on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Follow the on-screen instructions to train Google to the sound of your unique voice. Once
