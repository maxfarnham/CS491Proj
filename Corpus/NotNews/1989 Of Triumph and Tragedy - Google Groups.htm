<br>
<br>In a rough year for the game, Pete Rose is banned, a popular 
commissioner dies, a player's inspirational comeback from cancer is 
stopped cold and the local euphoria of a Bay Area World Series is badly 
shaken up by a major earthquake.
<br>
<br>Ten days after a major earthquake rocked--yet failed to bring 
down--San Francisco's Candlestick Park, the Bay Bridge World Series 
between the Giants and Oakland A's reconvenes before a packed house full
 of resistant fans looking to refocus on baseball.
<br>
<br>The renaissance of baseball was now complete. Awakened in the 
mid-1970s after an archaic deep sleep in the 1960s, the game was 
embraced like it hadn't been for 40 years; attendance was constantly on 
the rise, memorabilia sales were booming, and the game was fervently 
waxed nostalgic from Hollywood to the New York publishing world.
<br>
<br>But in 1989, baseball endured a seemingly endless string of 
challenges, some self-inflicted, others not, that put its newfound 
sentimentality at risk. It was a reminder that, no matter how glossed 
over the sport could get with old-timers' games, Brooklyn Dodgers 
paraphernalia and mint-condition Mickey Mantle cards, there were still 
troubles in modern times. 
<br>
<br>Before the year was out, baseball would witness the defrocking of 
its favorite son and its cynical link to a popular commissioner's death,
 a heartbreaking end to a gutsy comeback, and a World Series jolted to 
its knees by Mother Nature. 
<br>
<br>Even before the gates flew open for spring training, there was 
plenty of bad press to go around. The owners had just gotten socked, 
again, by a court ruling finding them guilty of further collusion 
against potential free agents. Wade Boggs, the prevalent American League
 batting champion, was ratted on by a former mistress who told--and 
showed--all for Penthouse. And Steve Garvey, the retired but 
still-popular baseball icon, had his "Mr. Clean"A memorable bumper 
sticker in the San Diego area read: "Steve Garvey is not my Padre." 
image dirtied up with a series of paternity suits. 
<br>
<br>Because baseball cares more about what happens between the lines, 
the commissioner's office had little use for such bedroom gossip. But it
 grew alarmed at allegations that were far more brooding: That Pete 
Rose, the game's all-time hit leader, was betting not only on baseball, 
but on the Cincinnati Reds--the team he managed. 
<br>
<br>Rose was initially queried by outgoing commissioner Peter Ueberroth,
 who seemed content with Charlie Hustle's answers. But he kept the case 
open and handed it to his successor, A. Bartlett Giamatti. A perfect 
choice to lead baseball in the day and age, Giamatti was a former Yale 
University president who spoke romantically of the game in poetic tones.
 Along with deputy commissioner Fay Vincent--whose dour, drone-toned 
fa√ßade was a sharp contrast to the whimsical Giamatti--the new 
commissioner hired former FBI mob investigator Robert Dowd to check 
further into Rose's gambling past. 
<br>
<br>At 2,300 pages and a cost of $3 million, the so-called "Dowd Report"
 painted Rose as a troubled man with a bad habit of befriending shady 
characters such as bookies and drug dealers. More troubling was the 
evidence; betting slips were produced showing Rose had repeatedly bet on
 baseball games--including those involving the RedsAccording to the 
slips, Rose always bet on the Reds to win.--in 1987. And that, according
 to those interviewed, was just the tip of the iceberg. 
<br>
<br>The investigation remained quiet until Sports Illustrated publicly 
blew the lid off the story during spring training when one of Rose's 
disgruntled bookies, Ron Peters, sang like a canary. Suddenly, Rose 
became a prisoner in his own dugout, trapped by a daily arc of 
reporters. His evasiveness to questions on the subject seemed peculiar 
for a man who often and gregariously spoke his mind. 
<br>Cincinnati finished second under manager Pete Rose from 1985-88--the
 years baseball alleged that Rose was betting on the Reds. Whether 
Rose's gambling habits affected his managerial decisions is debatable, 
but here are the facts of how close the Reds challenged for first place.
<br>As spring turned into summer, Rose appeared ready to buckle under 
the weight of the evidence when he got legal leverage from an unlikely 
source: Giamatti. The commissioner, whose job it was to be independent 
until all the facts were in, had decreed Ron Peters' testimony to be 
truthful--and that opened the door for a series of court battles in 
which Rose's lawyers charged that baseball had an anti-Rose agenda.
<br>
<br>The fierce tug-of-war segued into negotiations, and then to 
settlement. On August 24, it was announced that Rose was indefinitely 
banned from baseball, though he could apply for a reinstatement within a
 year. In exchange, baseball could not claim Rose bet on baseball, 
leaving a contradictory smell to the deal. The irony was hardly lost on 
Giamatti, who dropped the jaws of Rose and his lawyers when, at the 
press conference to announce the ban, answered the one question he 
wasn't supposed to: "I have concluded that he (Rose) bet on baseball." 
<br>
<br>Having to banish a living legend like Pete Rose was not what 
Giamatti, the idealistic Ivy Leaguer, had in mind when taking over the 
commissioner's office. Recovering from the emotional and physical burden
 of the Rose drama one week after its conclusion, Giamatti--a known 
chain-smoker--suffered a fatal heart attack at his Martha's Vineyard 
retreat. The renaissance sport had lost its renaissance manPete Rose 
released a statement after Giamatti's death, saying he was deeply 
saddened and had "great personal respect" for him.; Fay Vincent took 
over as baseball's commissioner. 
<br>
<br>Distracted by the Rose affair and wracked by injuries, the Reds 
stumbled to fifth place in the National League West, conquered for the 
second time in three years by the San Francisco Giants. 
<br>
<br>After falling a game short of a World Series appearance in 1987, the
 Giants were older, wiser and more talented in 1989. The continued 
evolution of first baseman Will Clark was expected--Clark hit .333 with 
23 home runs and 111 runs batted in--but unexpected was the sudden rise 
of outfielder Kevin Mitchell, who exploded after three years of 
displaying erratic potential with a NL-high 47 homers and 125 RBIs. 
Together, Mitchell and Clark not only formed a 1-2 punch worthy of 
Willie Mays and Willie McCovey, but also one among NL Most Valuable 
Player voters, with Mitchell edging out Clark. 
<br>
<br>A human interest story developed out of the Giants' pitching staff 
in Dave Dravecky. A reliable southpaw traded (along with Mitchell) from 
San Diego in 1987, Dravecky was diagnosed with a tumor in his pitching 
arm at the end of 1988 and had it removed--along with half of the 
deltoid muscle. Doctors were convinced the procedure would severely 
curtail his arm mobility and end his pitching career, but they were 
stunned to later see Dravecky miraculously rehabilitate beyond their 
expectations, and the impossible became possible when Dravecky started 
throwing a baseball with little velocity loss. 
<br>In his second start after a comeback from cancer, San Francisco's 
Dave Dravecky writhes in pain after breaking a bone in his pitching arm.
 The cancer would return and lead to an amputation of his entire left 
shoulder and arm.
<br>Quickly, impressively and cautiously working his way back through 
the Giants' minor league chain, Dravecky was given the go-ahead to make 
his first major league start of the season, August 10 in San Francisco 
against the RedsPete Rose, two weeks shy of his banishment, on Dravecky:
 "It's great for him. I hope he loses.". With the national spotlight 
upon him, Dravecky was magnificent, firing seven shutout innings before 
tiring in the eighth, the Giants holding on for a 4-3 win. 
<br>
<br>Baseball's first genuine (and badly-needed) feel-good story of the 
year took an excruciating u-turn in Dravecky's next start at Montreal. 
After throwing five shutout innings against the Expos, he got shaky in 
the sixth with a leadoff home run and a hit batsman. On his second pitch
 to the third batter, Tim Raines, a loud pop sounded as Dravecky threw, 
and he flailed uncontrollably to the turf in front of the mound. Will 
Clark, an avid game hunter, raced over from first base convinced that 
Dravecky had been shot. 
<br>
<br>A bone in Dravecky's pitching arm, structurally weakened by the 
tumor surgery, had snapped. Dravecky was carried off on a stretcher and 
later vowed he'd return to the mound. Doctors predicted a possible 
return for the postseason, but the euphoria had been sapped. 
<br>
<br>After taking the West, the Giants won a spirited NLCS in five games 
against the NL East champion Chicago Cubs, highlighted by a spectacular 
individual dual between the teams' young, star first basemen: Clark for 
the Giants, and sophomore Mark Grace for the Cubs. Grace repeatedly 
hammered at Giants pitching by hitting .647 (11-for-17) with three 
doubles, a triple and a home run. Yet Clark not only was slightly better
 (13-for-20, three doubles, a triple and two home runs), but also made 
his hits count--including a grand slam that pulled the Giants away in 
Game One, and a two-run, two-out single off Cub closer Mitch "Wild 
Thing" Williams in the eighth inning of Game Five to clinch the series. 
Yet even in jubilation, the Giants found sadness; Dave Dravecky re-broke
 his fragile arm when he got caught too deep in the mob of celebrating 
Giant players. 
<br>
<br>While the Giants were thrilled to be back in the World Series for 
the first time in 27 years, across the bay in Oakland, the Athletics 
were fiercely determined to get back to the Fall Classic after enduring 
off-season nightmares over their upset Series loss to Los Angeles the 
year before. 
<br>
<br>Despite injuries to key players--including Jose Canseco, who missed 
nearly 100 games to a broken wrist--the A's never slowed in pursuit of 
their second straight AL pennant. The team's hitting, affected the most 
by injury and far from proficient, was backed up by a healthy and very 
sharp four-man pitching rotation (Dave Stewart, Mike Moore, Storm Davis 
and Bob Welch) that combined for 76 wins and just 35 losses. 
<br>
<br>Crucially, the A's made the mid-season steal of the year when they 
brought back Rickey Henderson, struggling and stewingHenderson hit just 
.247 in 65 games at New York before being traded. under New York Yankee 
manager Dallas Green. Reacting like a free man in green-and-gold, The 
once-and-current Athletic tore apart the AL in the season's second half,
 batting .294 with 72 runs and 52 stolen bases in just 85 games. 
<br>After struggling and whining through the first half of the season 
with the Yankees, Rickey Henderson was granted a trade back to Oakland, 
where he first made his mark as a major league star. Henderson's second 
tour of duty with the A's clearly rejuvenated his game.
<br>With everyone healthy for the postseason and Henderson at the top of
 his game, the A's--who had won 99 games through all the aches and pains
 of the regular season--were now ready to shift into juggernaut mode. 
Against the feisty Toronto Blue Jays in the ALCS, the A's exhibited all 
their strengths. Dave Stewart won two games, closer Dennis Eckersley 
saved three and Jose Canseco hit a memorably titanic home run into 
Skydome's upper deck. But above them all was Henderson, who drove the 
Blue Jays absolutely crazy--batting .400 (6-for-15) with seven walks, 
eight runs, two home runs and eight steals. Bellicose Blue Jay manager 
Cito Gaston desperately resorted to mind games toward the end, accusing 
Oakland players of showboating and cheating, but the A's laughed him off
 and took the series in five. 
<br>
<br>For three years, talk of a Bay Bridge World Series had grown among 
Bay Area baseball fans watching their local teams emerge through the 
late 1980s. And after two decades of being told their region couldn't 
support two teams, they now had the ultimate showcaseIt was the first 
intra-market World Series since the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants
 squared off in 1956. all to themselves to brag about. 
<br>
<br>Unfortunately, that showcase would be upstaged by a more traditional Bay Area phenomenon: The San Andreas Fault. 
<br>
<br>The first two games of the World Series reconfirmed how focused the 
A's were at purging the ghost of Kirk Gibson, as terrific pitching 
silenced the Giants' bats at Oakland by scores of 5-0 and 5-1. 
<br>
<br>Game Three was moments away from beginning on an unusually warm and 
still evening at typically arctic Candlestick Park. As fans were taking 
their seats and players biding their time before introductions, a loud 
roar was heard--quickly followed by ominous movement underneath. The 
light towers and the second deck swayed and danced with one another 
above the box seats as the shaking continued for 15 seconds--or, in 
earthquake time, an eternity. 
<br>
<br>When it ended and all was safe, the fans heaved a huge sigh of 
relief, then let out a big cheer. They expected the game to go on, but 
the power was out and police, using bullhorns from the field, told 
spectators to leave the stadium at once. 
<br>
<br>As the fans exited, listening in on transistor radios and seeing a 
sky dotted with plumes of smoke, they realized this was no tremor. 
<br>
<br>Registering 6.9 on the Richter scale, the Loma Prieta Earthquake 
killed 65 people, injured 3,000 and caused over $10 billion in damage. A
 double-deck freeway near the Oakland Coliseum collapsed; the Bay 
Bridge, the very symbol of this World Series, was fractured. Among the 
homes heavily damaged in the hard-hit Marina section of San Francisco 
was that of A's pitcher Bob Welch. 
<br>
<br>Because Candlestick Park was built on bedrock and had just undergone
 a $28 million seismic retrofit, a catastrophe of epic proportions was 
averted and all 62,000 people within the stadium safely departed. 
Outside of Candlestick, the World Series helped save more lives; many 
people had gone home early to catch the game on TV, and thus the usually
 jammed freeways were light at 5:04 p.m. on October 17. 
<br>
<br>Commissioner Fay Vincent, whose naturally downcast demeanor 
perfectly mirrored the moment, was happy to give the World Series a week
 off while the Bay Area recovered--but had to armwrestle with San 
Francisco mayor Art Agnos, who demanded and gotVincent reluctantly 
agreed, but not before he threatened to move the series to Los 
Angeles--the ultimate insult to Bay Area baseball fans. an additional 
three days' delay. 
<br>
<br>The World Series--and the Oakland rout--resumed on October 27 at 
Candlestick, as offensive firepower picked up where the pitching left 
off. The A's crushed five home runs in a 13-7 Game Three thrashing, and 
jumped to an 8-0 lead in Game Four before surviving a late Giant 
counter-offensive to win the Series, 9-6. With the final out, the A's 
celebrated as any team normally would, running and leaping upon one 
another, but most of the fans simply applauded, said "nice job" and went
 home to resume their post-quake lives. 
<br>
<br>Mercifully, the year was done, yet its legacy persisted. Players 
declared free agency, and the owners actually paid heed to them. Bay 
Area residents rebuilt and moved on, understanding that the ground will 
occasionally shake beneath them. Cancer redeveloped in Dave Dravecky's 
pitching arm; by 1991, with the disease spreading, doctors had no other 
option but to amputate his left shoulder--though with sheer will and a 
strong spiritual conviction, Dravecky has become a highly respected and 
better man. 
<br>
<br>The same cannot be said for Pete Rose. He was stripped of all 
contact with baseball, and his freedom wasn't far behind; in 1990 it was
 the IRS' turn to dog Rose, who was convicted on tax evasion and 
sentenced to six months in jail with a $50,000 fine. 
<br>
<br>After 15 years of fiercely proclaiming his innocence, Rose performed
 an about face and admitted that he had, in fact, bet on the Reds in the
 late 1980s. He made his long-overdue contrition the only way he knew 
how; on his own terms, as part of a million-dollar book deal. Baseball 
was not impressed, and Rose remains banned while he gruffly and eagerly 
seeks reinstatement. The issue remains a white-hot topic of debate. His 
supporters say he's suffered enough--and besides, he bet on his Reds to 
win, so what's the harm? Plenty, say his detractors. Rose could have 
impulsively adjusted his lineups and pitching assignments when money was
 on the line at the expense of a 162-game focus. 
<br>
<br>For a team that finished second in the NL West four straight years 
under the stewardship of Rose, it begs to wonder: Did Rose's passion for
 the betting line unintentionally scuttle the Reds' chances for a World 
Series as much as those purposely thrown away by the 1919 Chicago Black 
Sox?
