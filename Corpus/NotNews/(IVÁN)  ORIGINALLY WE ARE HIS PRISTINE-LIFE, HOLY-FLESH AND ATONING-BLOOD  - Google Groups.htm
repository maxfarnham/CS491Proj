<br>
<br>
<br>ORIGINALLY WE ARE HIS PRISTINE-LIFE, HOLY-FLESH AND ATONING-BLOOD: 
<br>
<br>Our heavenly Father commanded His Rebbe Yeshua HaMoshiach (Jesus 
Christ) to meet Abram with bread and wine after he returned from chasing
 his enemies that had taken his nephew Lot prisoner along with his 
family and neighbors, because he had established a covenant of life with
 Him in heaven thus to be always faithful and blames in his entire life.
 Now, our Lord Jesus Christ presented himself to Abraham as God's 
Righteousness and high priest, because he was the King of Salem (ancient
 Jerusalem), so he may eat his bread and wine with our heavenly Father 
that was ready to meet him with his 318 disciples at the Lord's Table, 
and this is exactly where Jerusalem's holy hill will descend timely. 
<br>
<br>This was a very important meal that our heavenly Father had to eat 
with Abraham, since He had already called him to become his faithful 
servant thus to serve Him always blamelessly throughout his life in His 
holy presence, for he needed to eat with Him the bread and wine from His
 Son Jesus Christ's hands that will unite them, forever. Certainly, this
 was an important meal that our heavenly Father had tried to eat with 
Adam and Eve in paradise at the Lord's Table served by His Son Jesus 
Christ as the tree of life, but He had failed to sit with him, so the 
children may be born in perfect holiness, for the glory of His eternal 
name. 
<br>
<br>Surely, this was a covenant of life that our heavenly Father needed 
to start with Adam and Eve in paradise, because He was eager to start 
His new lasting Kingdom since the day that Lucifer along with one-third 
of the angels rebelled against Him and His Son Jesus Christ by trying to
 exalt himself above His holy name in heaven's glory. Furthermore, 
because Lucifer sinned against Him and His Son Jesus Christ, then he had
 to abandon heaven's glory along with all the fallen angels that had 
believed that he could exalt his lesser name above His holy name and 
that of His Son Jesus Christ, and so, the Holy Spirit cast him down into
 hell's torment with his angelic followers forever cursed. 
<br>
<br>Therefore, it was important now for our heavenly Father to find 
someone else as Abraham and his disciples to sit with Him at the Lord's 
Table to eat the bread and wine that is daily served by His Son Jesus 
Christ in heaven's glory to every angel, so holiness may prevail always 
through eternity. Timely, and to our heavenly Father's pleasure, His Son
 served the daily bread and wine over the Lord's Table to Abraham and 
his disciples to eat along with Him the meal that will be the beginning 
of a new life on earth that will never know defeat and destruction from 
Satan, because He will be the Only known Eternal God, forever. 
<br>
<br>This will be a new Kingdom not only of holy and faithful angels but 
also of His personal seed of children born by the power of the Holy 
Spirit, starting with Isaac with the sacred-flesh and atoning-blood of 
His Son Jesus Christ, because he will be the first man from His new 
angelic Kingdom that will never know the end into eternity. For this is a
 brand new Kingdom of His children born from the power of the Holy 
Spirit as Isaac was born first from his mother Sarai's barren-womb with 
the sacred-flesh, unbroken bones and the atoning-blood of His only Son 
Jesus Christ, so they may all live with Him in the perfect holiness that
 will never know the end even beyond eternity. 
<br>
<br>Therefore, this is what our heavenly Father had in mind as he sat 
down with Abraham and his allies to eat from the bread and drink from 
the cup of wine from His only Son Jesus Christ that is His only perfect 
holiness in heaven before the angels and on earth with every man, woman 
and child from all the nations. Then, as our heavenly Father ate with 
Abraham and his allies and drank as well from the cup of wine, 
religiously He was eating His Son Jesus Christ's sacred-flesh and 
drinking from his atoning-blood that will become the covenant of life 
between God in heaven and man on earth to give birth to Isaac from his 
mother Sarai's barren-womb. 
<br>
<br>And so, it was only by eating and drinking from our Lord Jesus 
Christ bread and wine that is his sacred-flesh and atoning-blood that 
granted the power of the Holy Spirit to give birth to Isaac from Sarai's
 barren-womb as Abraham's wife, so a new bloodline may be established on
 earth at last thus to replace Adam's ill blood and rebellious flesh. 
Therefore, by our heavenly Father eating with Abraham and his disciples 
at the Lord's Table from His Son's bread and wine, then He was ushering 
them into the world of the Holy Spirit, from where Isaac will be born by
 the power of the Holy Spirit from Sarai's barren-womb, so His Son's 
sacred-flesh and atoning-blood may take root on earth finally. 
<br>
<br>It is here, within the realm of the Holy Spirit, by eating and 
drinking from His Son Jesus Christ the bread and wine converted into the
 sacred-flesh and atoning-blood, then Isaac began to take shape in 
Sarai's barren-womb by the power of the Holy Spirit, so he may be the 
first man to be born in our heavenly Father's new Kingdom. Surely, as 
Isaac was born by the power of the Holy Spirit from his mother Sarai's 
barren-womb, then he was born with our Lord Jesus Christ's personal 
features as the hair and eye color, for example, along with sacred-flesh
 and atoning-blood that gave him the likeness of God's Lamb ready to 
ascend Mount Moriah to be offered as a burnt offering. 
<br>
<br>That is to say, also that Isaac was born in the perfect holiness 
that our heavenly Father had required from Abraham to possess forever 
just as He had possess it from eternity into eternity, so he may not 
only become saved to ascend into heaven's glory forever blessed but also
 the children, beginning with Isaac. Meaning that, as Isaac grew from 
childhood into adulthood then Abraham and Sarai were contemplating and 
living with our Lord Jesus Christ in person, because he will not only be
 the father and foundation of Israel but also the sacred-flesh and 
atoning-blood for the children to come, so they may live blessed as they
 may ascend into heaven's glory forever justified. 
<br>
<br>Obviously, this was something that our heavenly Father would never 
do with any holy angel, because Lucifer, being the great, glorious and 
powerful archangel that he had become since the day he was created by 
the power of His word, then he rebelled by trying to exalt his lesser 
name above His holy name with the help of one-third of the angels. 
Moreover, our heavenly Father failed to trust Adam and Eve, again, 
because they failed to eat from the fruit from the tree of life instead 
they ate from the forbidden fruit, from the tree of knowledge of good 
and evil, and this was something that they knew that they could never 
do, because they will die in sin, if they ever did. 
<br>
<br>Thus, our heavenly Father could never trust or give of His personal 
glory to any angel from heaven above, much less to any man in paradise 
or on earth, and so, our Lord Jesus Christ was the best choice as usual,
 so He may start His brand new legitimate offspring through His only Son
 Jesus Christ's life, sacred-flesh, unbroken-bones and atoning-blood. 
That is to say, also that the day that Isaac was born from his mother 
Sarai's barren-womb by the power of the Holy Spirit covenant of life 
started with Abraham and his disciples, as they ate the bread and wine 
from the Lord's Table, then our Lord Jesus Christ's divine-life, 
sacred-flesh, unbroken bones, and atoning-blood became the foundation of
 the new world. 
<br>
<br>For this is the new world of our heavenly Father's kingdom on earth 
coexisting with the nations, so His will may be done on earth as it is 
in heaven by the angels, for the nations to learn not only how to love, 
serve and glorify Him and His holy name but also how to escape darkness,
 death and hell's torment, forever. That is why, that it was essential 
that Abraham along with his disciples may sit with Him at the Lord's 
Table to eat the bread and drink from the wine from His Son, but also 
that they may enter together into the Holy Spirit's world, so this bread
 and wine may be born into His Son Jesus Christ's body through Isaac 
birth. 
<br>
<br>For Isaac to be the first man born into our heavenly Father's new 
world with the sacred-flesh and atoning-blood of His Son Jesus Christ 
ready to be taken by Abraham to Mount Moriah to be offered as a burnt 
offering unto our Father in heaven's glory, so sin may be destroyed 
along with Satan, for the new world to start pure. Meaning that, as 
Isaac was taken to Mount Moriah to be sacrificed by his father Abraham, 
because our heavenly Father had called him to do so over the mountaintop
 that He will personally show him, then it was done to the perfection 
that our Lord Jesus Christ in his day will do it, for sin and Satan to 
be destroyed at last. 
<br>
<br>That is to say, also that as Abraham took his only son Isaac to be 
offered as a burnt offering over Mount Moriah, then everyone could see 
in Isaac the sacred-flesh, the atoning-blood and even the hair, eye and 
skin color of our Lord Jesus Christ, because Isaac was a perfect replica
 of God's Lamb with the atoning-blood to remove sin, forever. However, 
the only difference between the two, though they were exact twins, 
except that Isaac was a man and our Lord Jesus Christ God's only 
begotten Son, because he had come out from Him, meaning that Jesus 
Christ had always existed within our Father and His Spirit, and so, he 
alone is God's Lamb with the atoning-blood ready to remove sin, forever.
 
<br>
<br>Moreover, our heavenly Father had Abraham to take his only son Isaac
 over to the mountaintop when he was only 8 years old not only because 
he was the perfect copy of God's Son Jesus Christ on earth thus to start
 the existence of Israel in the world, but also because he was very 
young and innocent to evil, sin, and wickedness. Isaac was perfect in 
holiness in our heavenly Father's sight, because he was from head to 
foot exactly as His only Son, and so, as He called Abraham to take his 
only son Isaac to the mountaintop to be offered as a burnt offering unto
 Him in heaven's glory, then He did it because Isaac was young, sinless 
and obedient unto death. 
<br>
<br>For this was exactly what Jesus Christ would do in his day, because 
he was born from David's virgin daughter through the Holy Spirit, so he 
may not only fulfill the Holy Spirit of the Ten Commandments but also 
destroy every sin, lie, curse, infirmity, and death thus to take the 
cross on Jerusalem's holy hill, to finish with evil, at last. Now, given
 that, Isaac had been born in the world of the Holy Spirit, because 
Abraham with his allies had eaten with our heavenly Father from the 
bread and wine served by His Son Jesus Christ as his sacred-flesh and 
atoning-blood, then Isaac's new body with the bloodline was born for 
Israel to exist on earth as God's eternal nation for eternity. 
<br>
<br>Therefore, it was important for our heavenly Father to have Abraham 
to take his only son Isaac to Mount Moriah not really to sacrifice him 
in a fiery burnt offering unto Him in heaven's glory, but also because 
our heavenly Father needed to see His Son Jesus Christ lying over His 
sacrifice altar thus to see every one of his children. Meaning that, as 
Abraham had his only son Isaac lying over our heavenly Father's altar at
 the mountaintop, then He not only could see the obedience of His Son 
Jesus Christ been displayed marvelously before Him in perfect eternal 
holiness, but also He could see every one of his brothers and sisters 
lying over the altar for the final non-stop sacrifice. 
<br>
<br>In other words, the day that our heavenly Father had Abraham laid 
down his only son Isaac over the mountaintop's altar for the burnt 
offering sacrifice, then He could not only see His only begotten Son 
Jesus Christ lying down his divine-life for everyone's ransom, but also 
He could see every man, woman and child from Israel lying as the 
non-stop sacrifice. On this day, our heavenly Father spoke directly from
 Jerusalem's holy hill with the three crosses from heaven above and with
 His Son Jesus Christ in the middle of them speaking to Abraham just as 
he would later speak to Jacob in his dream on the way to find his wife 
at his father Isaac relatives' hometown, in Padan-aram. 
<br>
<br>Timely, our Lord Jesus Christ said to Abraham: Do not hurt the lad, 
now I know that you will obey our heavenly Father, and that you will do 
everything that He will command you, so your children will follow the 
ways of the Lord, forever in this life and in the next one to come in 
heaven above for all eternity. Then, having our Lord Jesus Christ spoken
 to Abraham from the middle of the three trees, from Jerusalem's holy 
hill high above Mount Moriah, immediately Abraham stopped the process to
 kill his only son Isaac, and so, instead he was provided a lamb for the
 sacrifice to replace Isaac, because the sacrifice had to be executed 
with His love pouring abundantly after all. 
<br>
<br>Abraham as he stopped from sacrificing his only son over the altar 
at Mount Moriah, then he heard the cry of a lamb that had been caught by
 the horns on the twigs of two trees that were nearby, so he grabbed the
 lamb and sacrificed it instead of his son Isaac, so our heavenly Father
 may grant his only son blessings. Over the altar, Abraham gave thanks 
to our heavenly Father for having spared his only son Isaac from certain
 death, because he really thought that he had to kill him before our 
Father in heaven, so He may be pleased with him always, and then he 
descended with his son Isaac from Mount Moriah filled with blessings for
 his children to come. 
<br>
<br>Isaac descended Mount Moriah with a new heart that our heavenly 
Father had given him, because he now understood that he had to serve Him
 through His only Son, The Chosen Lamb from heaven above, as from 
Jerusalem's holy hill, because this was the destiny of his sacred-flesh 
and atoning-blood to one day shed it over the non-stop altar to end sin.
 And once our heavenly Father had Abraham to take his only son Isaac 
over the rituals of the mountaintop's altar thus to sacrifice him before
 Him in heaven's glory, then Isaac began to grow and serve our heavenly 
Father thus finally to grant him a son that will become his first 
offspring on earth for the nation of Israel to be born. 
<br>
<br>Surely, as Isaac married Rebecca then it was with the purpose that 
our heavenly Father will have His firstborn on earth to begin to give 
life to the nation of Israel, because the sacred-flesh and the 
atoning-blood that is of His Son Jesus Christ in Isaac, since only in 
him His descendants will be his children, then Jacob became God's 
firstborn. Meaning that, the day that Jacob was born from Isaac and 
Rebecca, then he was born from our Lord Jesus Christ's sacred-flesh, 
unbroken bones, and atoning-blood, so Jacob will be not only the 
firstborn of our Lord Jesus Christ on earth but also of the entire 
nation of Israel to make a new pact of eternal life at Jerusalem's holy 
hill. 
<br>
<br>Indeed, this new pact of life will certainly be at Jerusalem's holy 
hill in his dream to find a wife at Padan-aram, as our Lord Jesus Christ
 will meet him as God's firstborn in heaven, so Jacob as God's firstborn
 on earth may make a pact of life with God's only Son in heaven's glory,
 for Israel to receive the Promised Land. On this day, our Lord Jesus 
Christ as God's only Son in heaven's glory and before the angelic hosts 
granted Jacob as God's firstborn on earth the land of Canaan and the 
children also to populate it by the millions that no one could ever 
count them, because they will be as numerous as the stars in the 
universe. 
<br>
<br>Besides, while Jacob began to speak to our Lord Jesus Christ and 
receive the land of Canaan that had already been granted to Abraham and 
Isaac his father, then he could see angels ascending to heaven and 
others descending to earth with gifts, from God to the nations 
everywhere that love, exalt, and glorify Him through His only Son Jesus 
Christ. Jacob also could observe the fire of the Holy Spirit everywhere 
around the three crosses ascending into heaven's glory as into our 
heavenly Father's Home, furthermore he could see the entire ground 
spilled with the atoning-blood that had changed his life, forever, and 
so, he could only think of praying over the rock thus to anoint it 
abundantly with olive oil. 
<br>
<br>And over the anointed rock, Jacob prayed beholding the three crosses
 ascending into heaven's glory with our Lord Jesus Christ, in the middle
 of them, and he said: Oh God, if you feed me, and dress me, moreover 
you make sure that I may make it safe into my father's hometown to find 
my wife, then you will be my God forever. On this day, our heavenly 
Father's Holy Spirit did not only feed him the best of the land, 
moreover dressed him well so he may be presentable to his father's 
relatives thus to impress his wife that had been chosen by the Holy 
Spirit, then Jacob acknowledged the Holy Spirit in his life to be his 
God and of his children, forever. 
<br>
<br>The Holy Spirit became Jacob's God and of his children as well, 
because he realized that the Holy Spirit had blessed him in every way 
possible thus making sure that he was well fed and dressed to meet his 
wife from his father's relatives, and so the Holy Spirit filled him with
 children to form the twelve tribes of Israel. And the Holy Spirit began
 to form the nation of Israel, because it was our heavenly Father's will
 for this to be done as soon as possible by making sure that everyone 
born within Israel will be by the power and blessings of the Holy 
Spirit, by ensuring that the sacred-flesh and the atoning-blood were 
always present abundantly in perfect holiness. 
<br>
<br>Meaning that, the Holy Spirit had to guarantee to our heavenly 
Father in heaven that every one within Israel was been born in the 
sacred-flesh and the atoning-blood of His Son Jesus Christ that first 
had manifested within humankind as Isaac was born from his mother 
Sarai's barren-womb thus to become God's first man of His new angelic 
Kingdom on earth. For this is the nation where He would manifest His 
abundant glory through the blessed life of His only Son Jesus Christ, 
because this is lasting glory that He could never trust to any holy 
angel from heaven above, due to the angelic rebellion that He had 
suffered with Lucifer much less He could trust men in paradise and on 
earth. 
<br>
<br>Thus, our heavenly Father had to make sure that the first man to be 
born into His brand new angelic Kingdom on earth that He will rule 
forever into eternity, then it will have to be with His Son Jesus 
Christ's Righteous life, sacred-flesh, unbroken bones, and 
atoning-blood, so sin will never have to do anything with His new and 
lasting glory. Meaning that, the beginning of His brand new Creation 
just as the old one from heaven above with the angels and with humankind
 on earth, then it will have to be with His only Son Jesus Christ's 
manifested Righteous life, sacred-flesh, unbroken bones, and 
atoning-blood, so every one born from him in Israel will be His 
legitimate child, forever. 
<br>
<br>That is why, that our heavenly Father was always careful with them 
by granting strict laws, norms, and regulations that will help them to 
live a perfect and sane life that will be separated always from the 
nations, so their sacred-flesh and atoning-blood will never be 
contaminated from other people, because He had finally to see His Son 
over Jerusalem's holy hill. Certainly, our heavenly Father had to be 
very careful with Israel to wherever they went through the desert to 
meet the nations, because they could very easily make covenants that 
will eventually destroy them by mixing the sacred-flesh and the 
atoning-blood of the pact of life with sin and destruction, and so He 
had to intervene at times to save them. 
<br>
<br>However, as history shows us, Israel always wanted to have it her 
way, and so, Israel not only made covenants with foreign nations through
 the desert but also mixed with them, causing that the holiness in their
 sacred-flesh and atoning-blood that they had received divinely from 
Jesus Christ through Isaac's miracle birth by the Holy Spirit, then 
became useless to God. And this was our heavenly Father's never ending 
struggle with Israel as they went through the Sinai's desert to possess 
the Promised Land, then Israel always wanted to meet with the nations 
and at one point they also decided to have their King, named by them, 
and by doing this, immediately they rejected our Lord Jesus Christ; and 
this angered God. 
<br>
<br>It angered our heavenly Father so much that He did not show any 
resistance for them to have a king as the nations do, so they may learn 
what is to serve Him and their appointed king, and our heavenly Father 
allowed them to have their king, because they were going to learn the 
difference between serving Him and sinful men. Nevertheless, our 
heavenly Father continued to watch after them very attentively, so they 
will not mingle with the nations by giving their daughters to marry them
 or to take from the nations' daughters to marry their sons, so the 
sacred-flesh and the atoning-blood may not be contaminated much less 
compromised, because His only Son Jesus Christ had to be born 
blamelessly. 
<br>
<br>Moreover, our Lord Jesus Christ had to be born from them by the 
power of the Holy Spirit, from King David's virgin daughter, so he may 
not only grant us eternal life for the first time on earth, but also the
 sacred and glorified body to live it forever saved in heaven's glory by
 ascending Jacob's ladder into our Father's holy presence. That is why, 
that our heavenly Father often asked the Israelis by saying to them: 
Even though all the tribes of Israel have sinned by giving into 
marriages with the nations of the desert then at least try not to have 
the tribe of Judah sin this way, so the sacred-flesh and the 
atoning-blood may stay clean and free from contamination. 
<br>
<br>Sincerely, as our heavenly Father will speak like this to the 
Israelis then they never understood that the King Messiah was going to 
be born from the tribe of Judah, because His promised to King David was 
that one of his sons that will be perfect after His heart that he will 
sit in his throne at last to rule Israel forever. And this is Jesus 
Christ as David's son that was born after our heavenly Father's holy 
heart to do His perfect will within Israel just as it is done in heaven 
by the angels, because he will not only be born from the Holy Spirit but
 also he will be the one that will defeat Satan's lie, curses, 
infirmities, and death, forever. 
<br>
<br>Surely, our Lord Jesus Christ was the one born by the Holy Spirit 
from David's virgin daughter to be the one that will be after our 
heavenly Father's &nbsp;heart to keep the Holy Spirit of the 
commandments without ever breaking them, so he may destroy every sin, 
curse, infirmity, problem, difficulty and threat of death on earth and 
in hell's torment. And like our Lord Jesus Christ not one has ever been 
born on earth that did all the miracles and great wonders that not only 
liberated people from the power of darkness and the threat of death in 
hell's torment, but also set them free from their problems, 
difficulties, infirmities, so they may live a blessed life always with 
their loved ones. 
<br>
<br>What's more, our Lord Jesus Christ used to teach people that he 
alone is the way, the truth and the life; and that no one can ever enter
 heaven's glory to see our heavenly Father in person unless they may 
come through him by been washed clean from sin to ascend Jacob's ladder 
into eternal life forever saved. And the reason that our Lord Jesus 
Christ used to teach this powerful truth to the Israelis and the 
gentiles as well, it is because he is the one that is in the middle of 
the three crosses from heaven above over Jerusalem's holy hill ready to 
receive anyone willing to be washed clean from sin to ascend Jacob's 
ladder forever justified. 
<br>
<br>That is why, that Jesus Christ taught to Moses that he Is The One 
That Always Is that have the power to remove sin by the atoning-blood 
shed to the cross and to its ground to ascend immediately into heaven's 
glory through Jacob's ladder, so they may see our heavenly Father as He 
will embrace them with His fatherly love, everlastingly. That is why, 
also that our Lord Jesus Christ used to teach people within Israel that 
he alone is the door to ascend Jacob's ladder to enter into the New 
Jerusalem from heaven above, because he who may enter through him, then 
he is cleansed from sin, by the power of his atoning-blood shed to the 
cross and to the ground. 
<br>
<br>As it is written: whoever calls on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
 in the last days, then that one will be saved from the power of sin and
 eternal death in hell's torment, because as you may invoke his holy 
name then immediately his atoning-blood removes sin, so you may become 
Holy Spirit born to enter heaven's eternal life. In other words, as you 
may invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ then immediately you will 
find yourself standing over holy ground drenched with the atoning-blood 
that has shed from our Lord Jesus Christ as he was nailed to the middle 
of the three crosses over Jerusalem's holy hill, so you may become Holy 
Spirit born instantly, ascending into heaven. 
<br>
<br>Given that, only if you have become Holy Spirit born by invoking the
 name of our Lord Jesus Christ, then you will immediately not only be 
washed clean from sin but also you are entering into the world of the 
Holy Spirit where there is always abundant working power in your favor, 
so you may find help in anything concerning you. That is all, that our 
heavenly Father has always required from everyone from Israel and the 
families of the nations to invoke His only Son Jesus Christ's name, so 
you may immediately find yourself standing in drenched ground with his 
atoning-blood to remove sin, so as you may enter through him, then you 
will ascend Jacob's ladder into heaven's glory forever blessed. 
<br>
<br>That is why, that our Lord Jesus Christ said to his disciples: I am 
the door; he that enters through me, then he will ascend into heaven's 
glory through Jacob's ladder, the three crosses ascending into heaven's 
eternal life, escorted as always by his holy angels from Jerusalem's 
holy hill, so you will never find yourself lost in paradise. The holy 
angels from Jerusalem's holy hill are always there not only to help you 
ascend into heaven's glory through the door that is our Lord Jesus 
Christ but also to help you every step of the way through Jacob's 
ladder, so you may step into our heavenly Father's holy presence because
 He longs to see you in person for millenniums already. 
<br>
<br>Therefore, you need to invoke our Lord Jesus Christ's holy name, 
immediately, so you may find yourself standing in holy ground at 
Jerusalem's holy hill with the three crosses from heaven above waiting 
for you to speak to your living-savior that is right there as always in 
the middle of the crosses, because he needs to cleanse you from sin, 
forever. And as you may pass through him, because you need to pass 
through his sacred-body and atoning-blood to ascend through Jacob's 
ladder into heaven's eternal life, then, as you may go through him 
immediately your old-body stays behind, furthermore you will receive 
your new glorified body from him as an exchange to enter heaven 
justified thus to be perfect-and-holy into everlasting. 
<br>
<br>And this will be the time when you will enjoy our heavenly Father's 
holy presence, because your body and His are one, in the sense that you 
are now perfect-and-holy as He has always been since ever, so you may 
enjoy His holy presence and He will certainly enjoy yours without any 
sin-conflicts, because you are His offspring that started with Isaac. 
Because, you will always have to remember that Isaac's sacred-body 
emerged from His Son Jesus Christ as he personally served the bread that
 is his sacred-flesh and the wine that is his atoning-blood filled with 
eternal life and blessings that Abraham with his 318 disciples at the 
Lord's Table ate with our heavenly Father to enter into the Holy 
Spirit's world. 
<br>
<br>Timely, because Abraham with his disciples ate the bread and wine 
that is our Lord Jesus Christ's sacred-flesh and the atoning-blood, then
 Abraham's wife Sarai with her barren-womb and within the power of the 
world from the Holy Spirit, at once Isaac was born miraculously with the
 sacred-body of His Son Jesus Christ to ascend Mount Moriah to end sin 
immediately. And this is where you are coming from into the world, you 
were born from Isaac's sacred-flesh and atoning-blood because Abraham 
and his allies ate from the Lord's Table the bread and wine that Jesus 
Christ daily serves in heaven's glory to the angels to keep them 
perfect-holy-and-healthy to serve our heavenly Father by exalting and 
glorifying His holy name through eternity. 
<br>
<br>That is to say, also that our Lord Jesus Christ was the beginning of
 every man, woman and child in paradise, because the day that Adam was 
born then he was born by the power of the Holy Spirit through our 
heavenly Father's image to live according to His Son Jesus Christ's 
likeness (his sacred-flesh and atoning-blood) into all eternity in 
heaven. However, as we very well know Adam and Eve ate from the 
forbidden fruit, from the tree of knowledge of good and evil instead of 
eating from the tree of life, so they may eat from the bread that is the
 sacred-flesh and drink from the wine that is the atoning-blood thus to 
stay and live forever perfect-and-holy in paradise. 
<br>
<br>Definitely, because Adam and Eve sinned against our heavenly Father 
by failing to eat from the fruit of life that is His Son Jesus Christ as
 always serving the bread and wine from the Lord's Table to our heavenly
 Father, to the angels, and to everyone else willing to eat from his 
holiness, then they died in paradise to return to earth. Although, Adam 
and Eve returned to earth to die, our heavenly Father nonetheless 
continued to care for them, because He was ready to give His life to 
have them back in heaven, meanwhile this was impossible due to sin, 
however there was always a way back to heaven, and this is Jerusalem's 
holy hill through the door (God's Lamb) to Jacob's ladder. 
<br>
<br>At Jerusalem's holy hill, Adam and Eve had to be the cross that will
 receive His only Son Jesus Christ born by the power of the Holy Spirit 
from David's virgin daughter, so he may be nailed to them, because they 
could no longer invoke his holy name for salvation, since they were full
 of the forbidden fruit, forever. Therefore, this was the only way 
possible that Adam and Eve were going to invoke his holy name, sort of 
speak, though they were just dead trees crossed to each other to receive
 our Lord Jesus Christ with nails on his hands and feet, so through the 
power of his atoning-blood they may become saved from sin and hell's 
torment at last. 
<br>
<br>For there was no other way possible for Adam and Eve to become saved
 from sin and hell's torment much less the children could be redeemed 
unless His Son Jesus Christ was nailed to them with nails that will bind
 them thus never to separate from each other again for any reason, and 
so, at the cross we all became one for eternity. That is to say, also 
that as our Lord Jesus Christ was nailed to Adam and Eve's cross in the 
middle of the three crosses from heaven above, then every man, woman and
 child from all the families of the nations were nailed with our 
heavenly Father and the Holy Spirit, so we may become one in His Son 
Jesus Christ, forever. 
<br>
<br>Now, you may ask why our Lord Jesus Christ said: Father, why have 
you abandoned me. Then, it will be because this was the first time that 
our heavenly Father was contemplating His Son Jesus Christ taking on the
 sin of the world, and the suffering to take on the sin of every man, 
woman and child was terrible for Him and for His Holy Spirit that His 
Son felt abandoned momentarily, because he was dying everyone's death. 
<br>
<br>Our heavenly Father along with the Holy Spirit had to step back and 
away from our Lord Jesus Christ, because the burden to watch him die for
 our sins it was terrible to observe much less suffer along with him, so
 He had to step away with the Holy Spirit to cry until death was finally
 defeated and destroyed in his holy-body. Therefore, it was necessary 
first for our Lord Jesus Christ not only to fulfill the Holy Spirit of 
the commandments with his brothers and sisters within Israel before our 
heavenly Father, but also it was necessary for him to destroy: every 
sin, curse, lie, infirmity and death in the life of every man, woman and
 child to conquer finally Jerusalem's holy hill. 
<br>
<br>In other words, our Lord Jesus Christ could have never been able to 
take on the cross to ascend Jerusalem's holy hill with his brothers and 
sisters unless he had first fulfilled the Holy Spirit of the 
commandments by destroying every lie, curse, calumny, infirmity, 
deadly-viruses, darkness and death that has emerged from Satan and his 
fallen angels against God's children. Our Lord Jesus Christ had to 
defeat every thing wicked that has ever come out from Satan and his 
fallen angels before our heavenly Father thus to honor and exalt 
mightily the Holy Spirit of the commandments over Israel, Jerusalem's 
holy hill, and the nations through ages, so he may finally shed his 
atoning-blood to Jerusalem's holy hill to destroy sin, forever. 
<br>
<br>That is why, that as our Lord Jesus Christ was nailed to the cross 
of Adam and Eve, because he needed to save them, moreover reached out to
 the children, by taking on their sins to the full thus to suffer for 
their death unto hell, since each one of them had been born initially 
from his divine-life, sacred-flesh, and atoning-blood. This is why, that
 our Lord Jesus Christ suffered and cried terribly on the way to the 
cross, while been nailed to it, and as he was dying on it, because he 
suffered as he took on the sin of every one of his children, born from 
his divine-life, sacred-flesh, and atoning-blood, so he may rescue them 
from hell's torment, at last. 
<br>
<br>On the cross, our Lord Jesus Christ felt the pain to walk away from 
our heavenly Father and from the Holy Spirit forever cursed with sin, 
and the same he felt for every one of his children born from him in 
heaven's glory, and so, he suffered terribly because he lived our death 
and sufferings in hell's torment where our death never ends. That is 
why, also that as he died on the cross because he suffered entirely our 
sins and death, then he had to descend into hell to destroy the eternal 
places that had been born there as we were born on earth, so he may 
destroy them forever, so the angel of death will never again claim us as
 his personal property. 
<br>
<br>Besides, while in hell's torment, our Lord Jesus Christ manifested 
himself gloriously against Satan and his fallen angels, because by dying
 for our sins and suffering our death, then he had destroyed sin and 
death forever in the life of every man, woman and child that will invoke
 his holy name for salvation with the power to return to heaven anytime.
 That is why, that our Lord Jesus Christ as he ascended from hell's 
torment, eternally victorious against Satan and the angel of death, then
 he said: All power is given unto me in heaven, on earth and under the 
earth, for he alone can save anyone anywhere, and he has the power also 
to liberate those incarcerated in hell's cells, right now. 
<br>
<br>Further, because our Lord Jesus Christ has conquered all powers in 
heaven, on earth and under it, then as we may invoke his holy name to 
become liberated from the power of sin, instantly we are not only born 
again from the Holy Spirit, but also we may receive abundant blessings 
to enjoy every day as we may grow in his glory. Because, our Lord Jesus 
Christ while praying to our heavenly Father then he said: Father, the 
glory that you have given me, I have given it to them also, so they may 
not only enjoy the blessings and power of your holy name that you have 
granted on to me, but they may enjoy always life, peace, prosperity, and
 happiness, starting now. 
<br>
<br>Thus, we are vested in the powers of Jesus Christ and of the Holy 
Spirit before our heavenly Father, as we may invoke freely and anytime 
his holy name, so we may become cleansed from sin and become Holy Spirit
 born thus to live always blessed in the Holy Spirit's world even if we 
are still living on earth these days. We are certainly blessed by our 
heavenly Father through His Son Jesus Christ, because He loves each one 
of us just as He has always loved the Holy Spirit and His Son Jesus 
Christ, since we are his sacred-flesh and atoning-blood from where we 
began live in our heavenly Father's image thus to live according to His 
Son's likeness in heaven, perpetually. 
<br>
<br>Our heavenly Father feels love for each one of us, because we are 
His children that were born in His image to live according to His Son 
Jesus Christ's likeness of his sacred-flesh, unbroken bones and 
atoning-blood on earth these days and in heaven's glory forever into 
eternity, so we may live only to execute His will faithfully always. We 
are blessed by our heavenly Father every day of our lives these days, 
because He still is at Jerusalem's holy hill with His Son Jesus Christ 
not only as His perfect Righteousness but also as His well-trusted high 
priest and Lamb with the atoning-blood shed to the ground, of the three 
crosses from heaven's glory to remove sin.
<br>
<br>With our Lord Jesus Christ living in our hearts these days then we 
have no sins anymore before our Father in heaven, because we have 
invoked his holy name within our hearts to become Holy Spirit born into 
the world from heaven above where love, peace, happiness and eternal 
salvation thrive always, so we may only know our Father's goodness 
everlastingly. This is a glorious-life that our heavenly Father has 
granted to each one of us, because He still feels deep love within His 
very holy heart for us through His Son Jesus Christ's divine-life, 
sacred-flesh, and atoning-blood, so we can ascend Jerusalem's holy hill 
through the door and up Jacob's ladder into His holy presence to get our
 daily blessing right now. Amen!
