<h1 class="style1"><span class="style2">1989</span> Of Triumph and Tragedy</h1>
<p class="style3">In a rough year for the game, Pete Rose is banned, a 
popular commissioner dies, a player's inspirational comeback from cancer
 is stopped cold and the local euphoria of a Bay Area World Series is 
badly shaken up by a major earthquake.</p>
<p><img src="Baseball%20History%20in%201989%20%20Of%20Triumph%20and%20Tragedy_files/1989main.jpg" alt="Ten days after a major earthquake rocked—yet failed to bring down—San Francisco’s Candlestick Park, the Bay Bridge World Series between the Giants and Oakland A’s reconvenes before a packed house full of resistant fans looking to refocus on baseball." height="486" width="691"></p>
<p class="style4"><span class="style5">The renaissance of baseball was now complete.  </span>Awakened
 in the mid-1970s after an archaic deep sleep in the 1960s, the game was
 embraced like it hadn’t been for 40 years; attendance was constantly on
 the rise, memorabilia sales were booming, and the game was fervently 
waxed nostalgic from Hollywood to the New York publishing world.</p>
<p class="style4">But in 1989, baseball endured a seemingly endless 
string of challenges, some self-inflicted, others not, that put its 
newfound sentimentality at risk. It was a reminder that, no matter how 
glossed over the sport could get with old-timers’ games, Brooklyn 
Dodgers paraphernalia and mint-condition Mickey Mantle cards, there were
 still troubles in modern times.  </p>
<p class="style4">Before the year was out, baseball would witness the 
defrocking of its favorite son and its cynical link to a popular 
commissioner’s death, a heartbreaking end to a gutsy comeback, and a 
World Series jolted to its knees by Mother Nature.  </p>
<p class="style4">Even before the gates flew open for spring training, 
there was plenty of bad press to go around. The owners had just gotten 
socked, again, by a court ruling finding them guilty of further 
collusion against potential free agents. Wade Boggs, the prevalent 
American League batting champion, was ratted on by a former mistress who
 told—and showed—all for <em>Penthouse</em>. And Steve Garvey, the retired but still-popular baseball icon, had his <a class="tooltip" href="#">"Mr. Clean"<span class="classic">A memorable bumper sticker in the San Diego area read: “Steve Garvey is not my Padre.”</span></a> image dirtied up with a series of paternity suits. </p>
<p class="style4">Because baseball cares more about what happens between
 the lines, the commissioner’s office had little use for such bedroom 
gossip. But it grew alarmed at allegations that were far more brooding: 
That Pete Rose, the game’s all-time hit leader, was betting not only on 
baseball, but on the Cincinnati Reds—the team he managed.  </p>
<p class="style4">Rose was initially queried by outgoing commissioner 
Peter Ueberroth, who seemed content with Charlie Hustle’s answers. But 
he kept the case open and handed it to his successor, A. Bartlett 
Giamatti. A perfect choice to lead baseball in the day and age, Giamatti
 was a former Yale University president who spoke romantically of the 
game in poetic tones. Along with deputy commissioner Fay Vincent—whose 
dour, drone-toned façade was a sharp contrast to the whimsical 
Giamatti—the new commissioner hired former FBI mob investigator Robert 
Dowd to check further into Rose’s gambling past.  </p>
<p class="style4"><span class="style5">At 2,300 pages and a cost of $3 million, the so-called “Dowd Report” painted Rose as a troubled man</span>
 with a bad habit of befriending shady characters such as bookies and 
drug dealers. More troubling was the evidence; betting slips were 
produced showing Rose had repeatedly bet on baseball games—including 
those <a class="tooltip" href="#">involving the Reds<span class="classic">According to the slips, Rose always bet on the Reds to win.</span></a>—in 1987. And that, according to those interviewed, was just the tip of the iceberg. </p>
<p class="style4">The investigation remained quiet until <em>Sports Illustrated</em>
 publicly blew the lid off the story during spring training when one of 
Rose’s disgruntled bookies, Ron Peters, sang like a canary. Suddenly, 
Rose became a prisoner in his own dugout, trapped by a daily arc of 
reporters. His evasiveness to questions on the subject seemed peculiar 
for a man who often and gregariously spoke his mind.  </p>
<img src="Baseball%20History%20in%201989%20%20Of%20Triumph%20and%20Tragedy_files/1989side1.gif" alt="Cincinnati finished second under manager Pete Rose from 1985-88—the years baseball alleged that Rose was betting on the Reds. Whether Rose’s gambling habits affected his managerial decisions is debatable, but here are the facts of how close the Reds challenged for first place." class="floatLeft" height="311" width="388"><p class="style4">As
 spring turned into summer, Rose appeared ready to buckle under the 
weight of the evidence when he got legal leverage from an unlikely 
source: Giamatti. The commissioner, whose job it was to be independent 
until all the facts were in, had decreed Ron Peters’ testimony to be 
truthful—and that opened the door for a series of court battles in which
 Rose’s lawyers charged that baseball had an anti-Rose agenda.</p>
<p class="style4"> The fierce tug-of-war segued into negotiations, and 
then to settlement. On August 24, it was announced that Rose was 
indefinitely banned from baseball, though he could apply for a 
reinstatement within a year. In exchange, baseball could not claim Rose 
bet on baseball, leaving a contradictory smell to the deal. The irony 
was hardly lost on Giamatti, who dropped the jaws of Rose and his 
lawyers when, at the press conference to announce the ban, answered the 
one question he wasn’t supposed to: “I have concluded that he (Rose) bet
 on baseball.”  </p>
<p class="style4">Having to banish a living legend like Pete Rose was 
not what Giamatti, the idealistic Ivy Leaguer, had in mind when taking 
over the commissioner’s office. Recovering from the emotional and 
physical burden of the Rose drama one week after its conclusion, 
Giamatti—a known chain-smoker—suffered a fatal heart attack at his 
Martha’s Vineyard retreat. The renaissance sport had lost its <a class="tooltip" href="#">renaissance man<span class="classic">Pete Rose released a statement after Giamatti’s death, saying he was deeply saddened and had “great personal respect” for him.</span></a>; Fay Vincent took over as baseball’s commissioner. </p>
<p class="style4">Distracted by the Rose affair and wracked by injuries,
 the Reds stumbled to fifth place in the National League West, conquered
 for the second time in three years by the San Francisco Giants.  </p>
<p class="style4"><span class="style5">After falling a game short of a World Series appearance in 1987, the Giants were older, wiser and more talented in 1989.</span>
 The continued evolution of first baseman Will Clark was expected—Clark 
hit .333 with 23 home runs and 111 runs batted in—but unexpected was the
 sudden rise of outfielder Kevin Mitchell, who exploded after three 
years of displaying erratic potential with a NL-high 47 homers and 125 
RBIs. Together, Mitchell and Clark not only formed a 1-2 punch worthy of
 Willie Mays and Willie McCovey, but also one among NL Most Valuable 
Player voters, with Mitchell edging out Clark.  </p>
<p class="style4">A human interest story developed out of the Giants’ 
pitching staff in Dave Dravecky. A reliable southpaw traded (along with 
Mitchell) from San Diego in 1987, Dravecky was diagnosed with a tumor in
 his pitching arm at the end of 1988 and had it removed—along with half 
of the deltoid muscle. Doctors were convinced the procedure would 
severely curtail his arm mobility and end his pitching career, but they 
were stunned to later see Dravecky miraculously rehabilitate beyond 
their expectations, and the impossible became possible when Dravecky 
started throwing a baseball with little velocity loss.  </p>
<img src="Baseball%20History%20in%201989%20%20Of%20Triumph%20and%20Tragedy_files/1989pic1.jpg" alt="In his second start after a comeback from cancer, San Francisco’s Dave Dravecky writhes in pain after breaking a bone in his pitching arm. The cancer would return and lead to an amputation of his entire left shoulder and arm." class="floatRight" height="265" width="252"><p class="style4">Quickly,
 impressively and cautiously working his way back through the Giants’ 
minor league chain, Dravecky was given the go-ahead to make his first 
major league start of the season, August 10 in San Francisco <a class="tooltip" href="#">against the Reds<span class="classic">Pete Rose, two weeks shy of his banishment, on Dravecky: “It’s great for him. I hope he loses.”</span></a>.
 With the national spotlight upon him, Dravecky was magnificent, firing 
seven shutout innings before tiring in the eighth, the Giants holding on
 for a 4-3 win.  </p>
<p class="style4">Baseball’s first genuine (and badly-needed) feel-good 
story of the year took an excruciating u-turn in Dravecky’s next start 
at Montreal. After throwing five shutout innings against the Expos, he 
got shaky in the sixth with a leadoff home run and a hit batsman. On his
 second pitch to the third batter, Tim Raines, a loud pop sounded as 
Dravecky threw, and he flailed uncontrollably to the turf in front of 
the mound. Will Clark, an avid game hunter, raced over from first base 
convinced that Dravecky had been shot.  </p>
<p class="style4">A bone in Dravecky’s pitching arm, structurally 
weakened by the tumor surgery, had snapped. Dravecky was carried off on a
 stretcher and later vowed he’d return to the mound. Doctors predicted a
 possible return for the postseason, but the euphoria had been sapped.  </p>
<p class="style4">After taking the West, the Giants won a spirited NLCS 
in five games against the NL East champion Chicago Cubs, highlighted by a
 spectacular individual dual between the teams’ young, star first 
basemen: Clark for the Giants, and sophomore Mark Grace for the Cubs. 
Grace repeatedly hammered at Giants pitching by hitting .647 (11-for-17)
 with three doubles, a triple and a home run. Yet Clark not only was 
slightly better (13-for-20, three doubles, a triple and two home runs), 
but also made his hits count—including a grand slam that pulled the 
Giants away in Game One, and a two-run, two-out single off Cub closer 
Mitch “Wild Thing” Williams in the eighth inning of Game Five to clinch 
the series. Yet even in jubilation, the Giants found sadness; Dave 
Dravecky re-broke his fragile arm when he got caught too deep in the mob
 of celebrating Giant players. </p>
<p class="style4">While the Giants were thrilled to be back in the World
 Series for the first time in 27 years, across the bay in Oakland, the 
Athletics were fiercely determined to get back to the Fall Classic after
 enduring off-season nightmares over their upset Series loss to Los 
Angeles the year before.  </p>
<p class="style4"><span class="style5">Despite injuries to key players—including Jose Canseco, who missed nearly 100 games to a broken wrist</span>—the
 A’s never slowed in pursuit of their second straight AL pennant. The 
team’s hitting, affected the most by injury and far from proficient, was
 backed up by a healthy and very sharp four-man pitching rotation (Dave 
Stewart, Mike Moore, Storm Davis and Bob Welch) that combined for 76 
wins and just 35 losses.  </p>
<p class="style4">Crucially, the A’s made the mid-season steal of the year when they brought back Rickey Henderson, <a class="tooltip" href="#">struggling and stewing<span class="classic">Henderson hit just .247 in 65 games at New York before being traded.</span></a>
 under New York Yankee manager Dallas Green. Reacting like a free man in
 green-and-gold, The once-and-current Athletic tore apart the AL in the 
season’s second half, batting .294 with 72 runs and 52 stolen bases in 
just 85 games. </p>
<img src="Baseball%20History%20in%201989%20%20Of%20Triumph%20and%20Tragedy_files/1989side2.gif" alt="After struggling and whining through the first half of the season with the Yankees, Rickey Henderson was granted a trade back to Oakland, where he first made his mark as a major league star. Henderson’s second tour of duty with the A’s clearly rejuvenated his game." class="floatLeft" height="281" width="406"><p class="style4">With
 everyone healthy for the postseason and Henderson at the top of his 
game, the A’s—who had won 99 games through all the aches and pains of 
the regular season—were now ready to shift into juggernaut mode. Against
 the feisty Toronto Blue Jays in the ALCS, the A’s exhibited all their 
strengths. Dave Stewart won two games, closer Dennis Eckersley saved 
three and Jose Canseco hit a memorably titanic home run into Skydome’s 
upper deck. But above them all was Henderson, who drove the Blue Jays 
absolutely crazy—batting .400 (6-for-15) with seven walks, eight runs, 
two home runs and eight steals. Bellicose Blue Jay manager Cito Gaston 
desperately resorted to mind games toward the end, accusing Oakland 
players of showboating and cheating, but the A’s laughed him off and 
took the series in five.  </p>
<p class="style4"><span class="style5">For three years, talk of a Bay Bridge World Series had grown among Bay Area baseball fans</span>
 watching their local teams emerge through the late 1980s. And after two
 decades of being told their region couldn’t support two teams, they now
 had the <a class="tooltip" href="#">ultimate showcase<span class="classic">It was the first intra-market World Series since the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants squared off in 1956.</span></a> all to themselves to brag about. </p>
<p class="style4">Unfortunately, that showcase would be upstaged by a more traditional Bay Area phenomenon: The San Andreas Fault.  </p>
<p class="style4">The first two games of the World Series reconfirmed 
how focused the A’s were at purging the ghost of Kirk Gibson, as 
terrific pitching silenced the Giants’ bats at Oakland by scores of 5-0 
and 5-1.  </p>
<p class="style4">Game Three was moments away from beginning on an 
unusually warm and still evening at typically arctic Candlestick Park. 
As fans were taking their seats and players biding their time before 
introductions, a loud roar was heard—quickly followed by ominous 
movement underneath. The light towers and the second deck swayed and 
danced with one another above the box seats as the shaking continued for
 15 seconds—or, in earthquake time, an eternity.  </p>
<p class="style4">When it ended and all was safe, the fans heaved a huge
 sigh of relief, then let out a big cheer. They expected the game to go 
on, but the power was out and police, using bullhorns from the field, 
told spectators to leave the stadium at once.  </p>
<p class="style4">As the fans exited, listening in on transistor radios 
and seeing a sky dotted with plumes of smoke, they realized this was no 
tremor.  </p>
<p class="style4">Registering 6.9 on the Richter scale, the Loma Prieta 
Earthquake killed 65 people, injured 3,000 and caused over $10 billion 
in damage. A double-deck freeway near the Oakland Coliseum collapsed; 
the Bay Bridge, the very symbol of this World Series, was fractured. 
Among the homes heavily damaged in the hard-hit Marina section of San 
Francisco was that of A’s pitcher Bob Welch.  </p>
<p class="style4">Because Candlestick Park was built on bedrock and had 
just undergone a $28 million seismic retrofit, a catastrophe of epic 
proportions was averted and all 62,000 people within the stadium safely 
departed. Outside of Candlestick, the World Series helped save more 
lives; many people had gone home early to catch the game on TV, and thus
 the usually jammed freeways were light at 5:04 p.m. on October 17.  </p>
<p class="style4">Commissioner Fay Vincent, whose naturally downcast 
demeanor perfectly mirrored the moment, was happy to give the World 
Series a week off while the Bay Area recovered—but had to armwrestle 
with San Francisco mayor Art Agnos, who <a class="tooltip" href="#">demanded and got<span class="classic">Vincent
 reluctantly agreed, but not before he threatened to move the series to 
Los Angeles—the ultimate insult to Bay Area baseball fans.</span></a> an additional three days’ delay. </p>
<p class="style4"><span class="style5">The World Series—and the Oakland rout—resumed on October 27 at Candlestick,</span>
 as offensive firepower picked up where the pitching left off. The A’s 
crushed five home runs in a 13-7 Game Three thrashing, and jumped to an 
8-0 lead in Game Four before surviving a late Giant counter-offensive to
 win the Series, 9-6. With the final out, the A’s celebrated as any team
 normally would, running and leaping upon one another, but most of the 
fans simply applauded, said “nice job” and went home to resume their 
post-quake lives.  </p>
<p class="style4">Mercifully, the year was done, yet its legacy 
persisted. Players declared free agency, and the owners actually paid 
heed to them. Bay Area residents rebuilt and moved on, understanding 
that the ground will occasionally shake beneath them. Cancer redeveloped
 in Dave Dravecky’s pitching arm; by 1991, with the disease spreading, 
doctors had no other option but to amputate his left shoulder—though 
with sheer will and a strong spiritual conviction, Dravecky has become a
 highly respected and better man.  </p>
<p class="style4"><span class="style5">The same cannot be said for Pete Rose.</span>
 He was stripped of all contact with baseball, and his freedom wasn’t 
far behind; in 1990 it was the IRS’ turn to dog Rose, who was convicted 
on tax evasion and sentenced to six months in jail with a $50,000 fine. 
 </p>
<p class="style4">After 15 years of fiercely proclaiming his innocence, 
Rose performed an about face and admitted that he had, in fact, bet on 
the Reds in the late 1980s. He made his long-overdue contrition the only
 way he knew how; on his own terms, as part of a million-dollar book 
deal. Baseball was not impressed, and Rose remains banned while he 
gruffly and eagerly seeks reinstatement. The issue remains a white-hot 
topic of debate. His supporters say he’s suffered enough—and besides, he
 bet on his Reds to win, so what’s the harm? Plenty, say his detractors.
 Rose could have impulsively adjusted his lineups and pitching 
assignments when money was on the line at the expense of a 162-game 
focus.  </p>
<p class="style4">For a team that finished second in the NL West four 
straight years under the stewardship of Rose, it begs to wonder: Did 
Rose’s passion for the betting line unintentionally scuttle the Reds’ 
chances for a World Series as much as those purposely thrown away by the
 1919 Chicago Black Sox?</p>

<hr>
<p class="style6">It Happened in 1989</p>
<p><span class="style15">You’ll Always Have 1988</span><br>
  <span class="style3">Orel Hershiser</span><span class="style13">, who 
finished the 1988 regular season with his consecutive scoreless inning 
streak intact at 59, has it immediate snapped in the first inning of his
 first start in 1989 at Cincinnati on April 5. The Reds will go on to 
beat the Los Angeles Dodgers, 4-3, as Hershiser hurts his own cause with
 two throwing errors that lead to two unearned runs.</span>
</p><p><span class="style15">That’s B for Baseball—And a Billion</span><br>
  <span class="style13">Major League Baseball initiates a four-year 
television deal with CBS and ESPN that will bring in a record-smashing 
$1.6 billion in revenue. The deal ends one era with the demise of NBC’s 
longstanding Game of the Week—CBS will continue with the Saturday 
affairs, but on a limited basis—and begins another with ESPN’s Sunday 
Night matchups. The TV package will ultimately give CBS its second 
baseball-related headache, after its unsuccessful 1964-73 run as owner 
of the New York Yankees; the network loses so much cash on the deal that
 it ultimately asks MLB for some of it back—and will be denied.</span>
</p><p><span class="style15">Ryan and Rickey</span><br>
  <span class="style3">Nolan Ryan</span><span class="style13">, in his 
first year as a Texas Ranger, becomes the first major leaguer to strike 
out 5,000 batters in a career when he puts away Oakland’s </span><span class="style3">Rickey Henderson</span><span class="style13">
 on August 22 at Arlington Stadium. Ryan goes the distance and strikes 
out 13 on the night, but loses to the A’s, 2-0. Ryan will become an 
occasional thorn in Henderson’s ego; on the night the veteran speedster 
becomes the all-time stolen base king in 1991, his publicity thunder 
will be stolen by Ryan, who on the same night throws his seventh (and 
final) career no-hitter.</span>
</p><p><span class="style15">Black and White</span><br>
  <span class="style13">Former St. Louis Cardinal standout </span><span class="style3">Bill White</span><span class="style13">
 becomes the highest-ranking African-American baseball executive when he
 is named National League president. Though the owners will deny it, his
 move may be a reaction to complaints that baseball is dragging its feet
 in hiring minorities to top positions, a complaint made very topical a 
few years earlier when </span><span class="style3">Al Campanis</span><span class="style13"> made racially insensitive remarks on the ABC news program <em>Nightline</em>.</span>
</p><p><span class="style15">What Handicap?</span><br>
  <span class="style3">Jim Abbott</span><span class="style13">, born 
without a right hand, makes a strong impression as a rookie southpaw for
 the California Angels. The 21-year-old Michigan native will go 12-12 
with a 3.92 earned run average in 29 starts, beginning a ten-year career
 that will include 18 wins in 1990 and a no-hitter in 1993.</span>
</p><p><span class="style15">Game of the Year</span><br>
  <span class="style13">On August 23 at Montreal, the Dodgers defeat the
 Expos, 1-0, in a 22-inning affair that’s the second longest shutout in 
history and full of bizarre episodes. Among them: The ejection of the 
Expos’ mascot, Youppi, for needling Dodger manager </span><span class="style3">Tommy Lasorda</span><span class="style13"> a bit too much; the nullification of an apparent game-winning Expo run off a 16th-inning sacrifice fly when </span><span class="style3">Larry Walker</span><span class="style13">
 is called out for leaving third too early; and the Dodgers’ lack of 
walks—none, in fact—for the longest such game without one by one team. </span><span class="style3">Rick Dempsey</span><span class="style13">, 39, scores the game’s only run with a solo home run off </span><span class="style3">Dennis Martinez</span><span class="style13">, plucked from the starting rotation for emergency relief.</span>
</p><p><span class="style15">Son of Game of the Year</span><br>
  <span class="style13">Earlier on June 3, the Dodgers engage in another
 22-inning epic at Houston that is an hour longer by time—seven hours 
and 14 minutes, the longest night game in NL history. The Dodgers’ 
roster is stretched so thin towards the end, pitcher </span><span class="style3">Fernando Valenzuela</span><span class="style13"> is sent in to play first base for the final two innings. </span><span class="style3">Orel Hershiser</span><span class="style13">, on two days’ rest after his previous start, pitches seven innings of shutout relief; his replacement, third baseman </span><span class="style3">Jeff Hamilton</span><span class="style13">—the ninth Dodger pitcher on the night—tosses the final two innings and is charged with the loss when </span><span class="style3">Rafael Ramirez</span><span class="style13"> singles home </span><span class="style3">Bill Doran</span><span class="style13"> to give the Astros a 5-4 win.</span> 
    </p><p><span class="style15">Double Deion Duty</span><br>
      <span class="style3">Deion Sanders</span><span class="style13">, 
the flashy two-sport star using September to commute between the Yankees
 and football’s Atlanta Falcons, becomes the first person ever to hit a 
major league home run and score a NFL touchdown in the same week. 
Sanders will reach the bleachers at Seattle against the Mariners on 
September 5, and five days later will reach the end zone on a 68-yard 
punt return for the Falcons against the Los Angeles Rams. Although 
Sanders will become a highly respected, Hall-of-Fame defensive back on 
the gridiron, his baseball career will be largely erratic with 
occasional flashes of brilliance.</span><br>
    </p><p><span class="style15">For Those Who May Have Showed Up Late…</span><br>
      <span class="style13">The Reds set a major league record for hits 
in an inning when they wrap out 16 in the bottom of the first against 
the Astros on August 3. The offense barrage including three doubles and a
 home run, all of which leads to 14 runs. The Reds win 18-2 on 26 hits, 
with seven players collecting at least three hits each.</span>
    </p><p><span class="style15">Nifty Fifty</span><br>
      <span class="style3">Vince Coleman</span><span class="style13"> 
sets an all-time mark when he steals 50 consecutive bases without being 
caught. The streak begins on September 18, 1988 and ends July 28 at 
Montreal. For the year, Coleman steals 65 bases and is caught ten times.</span>
          </p><p><span class="style15">So Close, And Yet So Far</span><br>
      <span class="style13"> In a 2-0, 13-inning loss to the Reds at St.
 Louis on August 30, the Cardinals leave 16 men on base—the most ever by
 a team suffering a shutout. The Cardinals had runners in scoring 
position in six innings and twice left the bases loaded. By comparison, 
the Reds leave only one man on base for the entire game. Starting St. 
Louis pitcher </span><span class="style3">Jose DeLeon</span><span class="style13"> has an 11-inning, one-hit effort (with no walks) wasted.</span>
          </p><p><span class="style15">Unassisted Victory</span><br>
      <span class="style13"> On June 25, the New York Mets become only 
the second team in modern big league history to record all of their outs
 unassisted in a 5-1 defeat of the Philadelphia Phillies at Shea 
Stadium. Thirteen of the 27 outs come courtesy of strikeouts from 
starter </span><span class="style3">Sid Fernandez</span><span class="style13"> and reliever </span><span class="style3">Rick Aguilera</span><span class="style13">.</span>

</p><p class="style13"><span class="style5">Skydome, Toronto</span> The 
last of the multi-purpose stadiums, Skydome became an instant—if not 
expensive—jewel in the Toronto skyline, with a half-billion dollar price
 tag over twice the original estimate; in 2000, it declared bankruptcy. 
Until then, Skydome is the place to be, catapulting the Blue Jays to the
 top of the team attendance charts with yearly totals of around four 
million from 1990-93. (That an exciting Blue Jay team won back-to-back 
World Series in 1992-93 didn’t hurt.) The facility is topped by a 
unique, massive and intimidating roof structure that contains four 
separate panels gyrating around one another into a closed position. 
</p><p class="style13">Skydome’s numerous amenities include a running 
track that encircles the stadium from the top of the upper deck; several
 eating establishments and bars, including McDonald’s and a Hard Rock 
Café; and a 348-room hotel located behind center field, with 70 rooms 
getting a glimpse of the action on the field—which on a few occasions 
has taken a backseat to the action in those hotel rooms, where couples 
have displayed conjugal relations in full view of the crowd. Skydome is 
the last new venue for big league baseball to include artificial turf. 
Renamed Rogers Centre (after Rogers Communications, which bought the 
Blue Jays) in 2005.
