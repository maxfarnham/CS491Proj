<p>The difference is you have a choice in purchasing consumer goods. 
Your money goes where you want it to go, and those long hours are a 
choice . . . you can always go back to school and choose another path. 
In the Soviet Union your choices where limited because a government 
planning committee decided how much of x or y was needed.</p><p>You 
should also look up the definition of dystopia. Since you need to use 
the phrase "another form of dystopia" what you're probably thinking of 
is another word.</p>

<p>Our US family once lodged some touring Russian folk musicians during 
the Soviet era.  They were pretty good sorts.  The musicians, who like 
many Russians of the period were fairly handy craftsmen - were also 
reduced to tears when my father took them down to the local discount 
store and bought them several packs of jig saw blades.  The tears 
weren't so much at my father's kindness, but stress, knowing that US 
$4.95 would buy two dozen + jigsaw blades of good quality - and was for 
us, pocket change. The cost of a meal.  Supply wasn't a problem either. 
   This was a small southern backwoods town - no Potempkin village.</p><p>Basic
 staples of life were more or less available after the 50s in the USSR, I
 mean you could meet your caloric needs. But for craftspeople - even 
basic tools were just not 'available'   Unless lifted and bribed from 
worksites or places of production. And they were needed. The average 
craftsman and handyman in the USSR basically had to scrape everything 
together just to have enough resources to undertake repairs of 
everything domestic and then some. Everything that wasn't military or 
important enough to have a state committee running it-   those things 
were pretty much just held together with bailing wire and odd sized 
nails for the duration.</p>

<p>Our neighbors growing up were german immigrants with family in the 
east.  They once managed to bring a sister over for a visit, who 
promptly broke down into tears upon entering a supermarket and seeing 
the abundance of food available.   Things under those regimes were truly
 terrible.</p><p>Anyone who believes communism (or even the deep 
socialism as practiced in say, Venezuela) is actually a good thing is 
what their rulers refer to as a "useful idiot".</p><p>Freedom is a free market, be it for goods, services or ideas.  Anything else is tyranny.  And tyranny is always the problem.</p>

<p>I actually cannot entirely dismiss Communism*, based on absence of 
practical data as we've never really seen it in a pure form - and I'm 
not actually sure we will. It requires reasonably perfect, selfless 
humans. Of which we are obviously not, so historically attempts at 
Communism tip over immediately into crony/bolshevik/nomenklaturist 
states.</p><p>*At least as an academic exercise.  Alors.</p>

<p>Wow, forty million people starved, shot, tortured, worked to death in
 labor camps, and it's just "water under the bridge" to you?  Would you 
tell the Jews, Gypsies and Gays killed by the Nazis that it was just 
water under the bridge and they should forget it and move on?</p><p>The 
rest of us aren't going to let the world forget these atrocities.  
Because when the atrocities are fogotten, the ideologies behind those

<p>Indeed, Amanda, what about them?  This is an article on the former 
Soviet Union and their Warsaw Pact "allies" (client states) in Europe in
 the Twentieth century.  Nothing at all about North America or the 
Seventeenth century.  We can well discuss any one atrocity without 
playing a zero-sum moral equivalency game that requires us to mention 
every other atrocity.  But that's some textbook moving of the goalposts 
and distraction technique Amanda.</p>

<p>The problem is this degenerates into the same endless "whipping boy" 
argument that works to drag any discussion into the same predictable 
death spiral. We should be past this now. How many people realistically 
believe Russia or China is likely to go through another 20-50 million of
 their citizens in the near future ?<br>The author was simply trying to 
illustrate how refreshing or disarming it was to visit a different 
country or region where the constant spector of Madison ave. and 
consumer capitalism was conspicuously absent.<br>Who's moving the goalposts here ?</p>

<p>Actually that's not true.  When it comes to creating a 'worker's 
paradise' no system has enabled governments to kill their own people 
like Communism has.  The Soviet Union killed somewhere around 20-25% of 
its total population over 20 years (almost everyone in western Ukraine),
 China managed only a paltry 5-10% (but 50,000,000 still adds up if you 
keep doing it), and Cambodia managed a solid 25% (they were going for 
the record, but Vietnam invaded and spoiled their party).  All of these 
were based on the same premise:  "If we just kill all the inconvenient 
ones then the worker's paradise will emerge".   So no, it wasn't a few 
bad apples.  The barrel was toxic.</p>

 subscribes to a supply-side economic theory i.e. if you only provide

<p>The article in WIRED does not include the three essays in the book. 
My own essay described the ingenuity of an underground economy operating
 behind these windows. I should also say that I met many smart, 
cultured, ironic, intelligent and creative people while traveling there 
and, as in the West, their happiness didn't hinge on whether they could 
buy ostentatious luxury goods or not. Family and community can and do 
thrive both within and outside of their opportunity to consume more than
 their essential needs. Even our most tired cliche claims that "money 
can't buy you love…."</p><p>What I did discover is that I myself had 
lived my entire life surrounded by the artificially happy faces of 
advertising models. We ought not be tricked by our own shop windows. 
These photoshopped gods and goddesses reflect an effortless prosperity 
that can neither be achieved nor sustained. Our advertising machine 
drives our consumption to the point of keeping us all (and our 
environment) in debt. Our advertising culture gives us permission to 
dismiss the needs of the poor, mock the homely, fill the oceans with 
plastic packaging and spend like there's no tomorrow.</p><p>I would 
never promote the communist model as a desirable alternative. It was 
clearly not. But, as I have written, those systems were overthrown 
through intellectual discourse from within and not by cowboy 
brinksmanship. History cannot be reduced to the simplicity of a spy 
thriller. Real people live real lives in real time.</p><p>The failure of
 communism does not automatically give us a free ticket to limitless 
growth. I fear that the jingoism of some responders can too easily 
render us as spotless champions of the world. We are not.</p><p>While 
defending free enterprise, we often turn a blind eye to our own massive 
release of environmental pollutants. We participate as slave owners in 
the guise of stock holders in third world sweat shops. Our malls are 
filled to the brim with goods too cheap to warrant our own precious 
labour. We hypocritically support oil and resource wars while claiming 
to support citizens' freedom. Shock and Awe was aimed at taking down one
 renegade despot but it actually killed countless innocents and 
displaced millions. Our profit/loss calculations have given us the logic
 to support all sorts of tyranny.</p><p>Don't let these empty shop 
windows vindicate the glut of our own mega malls. It is the old 
paradigm. It is the propaganda we absorb as truth.  That is exactly my 
point. Let's examine these windows and the effect they have had on our 
own assumed entitlements.  Could the free market blind us with bling?</p><p>Civil
 rights, gay rights, feminism, labour unions, pacifism, 
environmentalism, public education and universal health care have all 
been derided as "communist plots" at one time or another.</p><p>Yes we are free… but are we also responsible?</p>

<p>Thanks to the contributors who have judged my book without reading 
it.  I appreciate that in the "free market of ideas", one can judge a 
difficult idea without taking the time or thought to understand its 
nuances.  I'm pleased that so many bloggers have shown us their 
knowledge of the history of tyranny.  But their comments have very 
little to do with the pictures or texts in my book.  I offer nothing to 
defend Stalin or Mao in my book. Their tyranny happened decades before 
my project. I have produced this project in sympathy for folks on both 
sides of the Iron Curtain. They were my ancestors and my neighbours.</p><p>The
 good citizens of the Soviet bloc overthrew ten communist governments in
 a space of 18 months (more or less) and these revolutions were 
relatively bloodless.  What I did do is show that familiar human beings 
with familiar human needs had familiar human lives on the other side of 
an ideological divide.  Remember that in 1986, East and West had enough 
nuclear weapons to turn the planet into a sorry little cinder.</p><p>Remember
 too that our own military might has levelled entire cities and cultures
 under the pretence of saving them. Let's not dismiss collateral damage 
in the tens of thousands. Remember that our so called "free market of 
ideas" did not give blacks their full civil liberties until nearly two 
hundred and fifty years after the Declaration of Independence. It did 
not given women the vote for a hundred and fifty years. Our "free 
market" did not protect Detroit workers from financial ruin.   Our "free
 market" does not protect the environment from corporate abuse.  Our 
"free market" does not guarantee health care or education for all of 
those living within it.</p><p>Freedom is a work in progress.  Ideas are never as dangerous as ignorance.</p>

<p>No problem, if you wish to have your work judged you've come to the right place.</p><p>I
 suspect most folks are engaged by the photos, they certainly tell a 
story about a life that was profoundly different than people in the West
 were living.  My problem is with your interpretation.  Why do shops 
have display windows?  To entice passers-by to purchase items in the 
shop.  When a shopkeeper has nothing to sell he goes out of business, 
but what happens when a society has nothing to sell?  Those empty shop 
windows weren't a matter of choice, as the article suggests.</p><p>Yes, 
Western society has many failings.  To paraphrase Churchill, it is the 
worst system in the world except for all the others.  Perhaps one day it
 will get so bad that people will cease risking their lives to get here.
  Perhaps we'll all try to sneak into Albania or something.</p>

<p>I did not write the article.  I wrote the book.  I didn't suggest 
that sparely filled windows were a matter of choice. I'm surprised that 
Steve thinks that wall-to-wall, cradle-to-grave consumer seduction is 
his own deliberate choice. It's not.</p><p>I have been watching 
television for more than six decades and I can say its psychological 
manipulation has escalated enormously.  Watch and learn.  Prime time 
drama features sexual betrayal, theft, anger, righteousness and bloody 
murder in ever increasing dosages.  Adrenaline spikes with suspense and 
helplessness.  Every ten minutes or so (at the cliff hanger moment) we 
are taken away to a consumer fantasy where we can drive a $50,000 car 
with a perfectly willing goddess by our side… or acquire perfectly 
aligned teeth that shine brighter than a full moon… or quench our thirst
 with corn-sugar water and red dye in throw away bottles.</p><p>Switch 
to the news… bad guys and good guys proving that the drama on the other 
three hundred channels is real.  Buy an insurance policy. Buy a 
vacation. Buy a giant plate of salty, greasy french fries… buy anything 
to relieve the stress.</p><p>I didn't claim that I saw a better system. 
 I only said that I experienced some relief when the seduction pressures
 were a bit quieter.</p>

<p>Advertising is not my choice, you are correct.  Consuming is my 
choice.  Those folks behind the nasty old Iron Curtain (and a fine bit 
of spin THAT was!) didn't have the choice whether or not to consume.  
For the record, I don't think you're deluded or a bad person and I 
applaud your project as something worthwhile.  I just don't agree with 
all your conclusions.</p><p>Pollution is generally an artifact of 
poverty, or more accurately of scarcity.  When sufficient wealth becomes
 available (see 'free market systems') things get cleaned up.  That's 
why West Germany had to spend a zillion dollars cleaning up the mess in 
East Germany after reunification.  That's why Russia continues to wreak 
havoc on the environment with their ridiculous timber harvesting and 
gas/oil extraction practices.  If we tried to do what they do, we would 
all be in jail.  I just got back from a winter in southeast asia, those 
folks have recently been turned loose and they are all extremely busy 
creating wealth to better their lives and the lives of their children.  
I'm sure they care about pollution and the environment, but it's awful 
low on their list.  At least they don't have to worry about habitat for 
the animals, because they ate them all.</p><p>So yes, democracy and the 
free market system and banks and multinational corporations all suck.  
But no one has come up with something that works better yet, so we will 
continue to chip away at improving what we have.  Nostalgia is a 
dangerous delusion, because 'the good old days' invariably sucked.</p>

 grew up a few hundred yards away from a toxic tailings pond in northern
 Ohio.  My father headed a chemical research team that made some nasty 
stuff.  He did it to support his family…and  to support our national 
defence against commie boogiemen in far-away places. A few years ago, I

<p>For me these signs were straight to the point. Probably because they 
really didn't have something else to sell than just one thing or one or 
two models of whatever they sold.</p><p>In exchange, we in the West are used to see store windows filled with extravaganza and appearance of opulence.</p><p>It has to look expensive in order to attract our attention.</p><p>Of
 course, there is a point where things start looking cheap again, when 
there are too many flashy items that detract from noticing the star 
products. Except with chocolatiers and bakeries; we have never enough of
 those things enticing us in store windows, it seems.</p>

static items like gold do things start to get iffy.</p>
