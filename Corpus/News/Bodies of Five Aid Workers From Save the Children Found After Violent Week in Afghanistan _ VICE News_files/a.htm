<p>Vice Improve your life wirh liver pool <b>&lt; i started working 
online, completing some basic jobs that only requires from you a 
computer and internet access and I am happier than ever... It's been 6 
months since i started this and i got paid so far total of 36,000 
bucks... Basicly i profit close to 80 bucks/h and work for 3-4 hrs most 
of the days.Best part to whole this thing is that you can decide when to
 work yourself and for how long and you get a paycheck at the end of

<p>haha, I wore that same outfit in a play when I was 2. Wish I would 
have been there. Looks like the gays had a go at them at least. If that 
last lady had had a firearm I'm pretty sure she would have opened up 
with it, or maybe she did and was contemplating the possibilities. What 
city was that? It was either old or a poor city, or the footage was old;
 those old articulated busses were decommissioned years ago in most 
places.</p>

<p>ok, its dealt with. that mike guy was doing pretty well but I gave 
him a hand anyway. heres a sample after she tried to put him down I 
wrote this:</p><p>Nah, he looks like a regular, rational guy whilst you 
appear the raging, lunatic, tin foil hat wearing trog on the corner with
 a megaphone and that particular peculiar odor of bung and old grease. 
He is the guy walking down the street minding his own business and you 
are the sandwich board wearing moron who leaps out from behind a 
lamppost and manages to engage him. Pity him for trying to respond to 
something like you with something like reason.</p>

<p>NYC, I think. Most of these clowns release their flatulent gasses in 
NY, DC, and Chicago. I've seen these schmucks preachin' their

to hear them spew, nodding in moronic approval.</p>
