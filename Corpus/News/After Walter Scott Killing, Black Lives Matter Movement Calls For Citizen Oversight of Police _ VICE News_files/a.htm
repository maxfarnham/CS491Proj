<p>i am not questioning his intention. truly heroic. but for every such 
incident videoed there are a dozen more where cops go free due to lack 
of video.<br>had he withheld the video and leaked it after the cop went 
free there would be a bigger outrage and this "internal investigation" 
"court of law" would be completely exposed as  a sham. there would 
probably be a reinvestigation and retrial where the cop would be 
convicted. and it would strike fear in every such investigation and 
judgement that some leaks would surface which would shame them and 
expose their biasness. hopefully that will force them to be not so 
blatant to such crimes!<br>it's a shame we are having to think of such methods!</p>

<p>"Black Lives Matter" is a distracting straw man…it's racist and 
offensive. Cops brutalize people of every type, everyday. The corrupted,
 unaccountable system of policing will NEVER be resolved if its issues 
are all pigeonholed into a singular issue of race. Racism is a symptom, 
not a cause. Framing the discussion in that manner is a distraction from
 enacting real change to this devastatingly oppressive system.</p>
