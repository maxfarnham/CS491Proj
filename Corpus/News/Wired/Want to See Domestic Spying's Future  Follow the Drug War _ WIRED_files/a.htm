<p>You will never be able to "End" the war on drugs.  As long as drugs 
exist, they will have to be battled.  You can change the way in which 
the war, or whatever you'd like to call it, is fought, but you cannot 
simply decree and to to it.</p><p>1) You cannot simply decriminalize 
drugs.  Heroin (and its derivatives like oxy and other..codones), Meth, 
and coke will always be illegal.  For various reasons.  In part, because
 they are dangerous, but mostly because no politician in their right 
mind would ever author a bill to legalize these drugs.  The first 15 
year-old who dies will immediately be the public face of that 
politicians candidate and will likely drive them right out of office.  
It's political suicide.</p><p>2) Even if you decriminalize drugs, there 
will always be money to be made in the sales.  And if there's money to 
be made, people will result in criminal and violent tactics to ensure 
their money flow is not interrupted.  Do people really think if drugs 
are decriminalized, drug dealers and drug rings will vaporize?  That 
just because RJ Reynolds sells Meth in a fancy box and calls it "Crystal
 Dreams", that it still won't be sold underground?</p><p>And please stop
 comparing Prohibition in the 20's and 30's to today.  It is very 
difficult to produce alcohol in volume in a hotel room in one weekend, 
or get 1 million bottles of Gin across the border.  It's apples and 
oranges.</p><p>3) If you legalize and Tax it, the DEA will just become 
an enforcement branch for the IRS and Franchise Tax Boards.  No one 
likes getting their cash flow slowed worse than corporations and the 
Gub-mint.</p><p>4) Children will never be allowed to use drugs.  Even 
Colorado's law, which seems to be effective, is restricted to 21+(IIRC).
  And since kids typically have access to $$, there will be people who 
sell it to them.  Where do you draw that line?</p><p>It is an incredibly
 complex issue, but it won't be solved by some utopian dream of ending 
the Drug War.  While I agree that there are problems, with laws, 
mandatory sentences, some enforcement practices, the "War" on drugs will
 be waged forever.  Or at least until you destroy the demand for them.  
If no one wants drugs, there will be no drug problem.</p>

<p>I'd like to see studies for countries other than Portugal.  One 
country in a different continent does not make a very good sample size. 
 Especially a country that is less than 1/30th the size.  This isn't 
Europe.  Just because something works there, doesn't mean it will 
translate here.  We are a different animal with completely different, 
complex issues.</p><p>You can dismiss my points all you want, but it 
doesn't change the fact that they're valid.  You call it a waste of 
space, I call it reality.</p><p>But I guess I chose to confront the reality in front of my face and not to live in a naive dreamscape.</p>

<p>None of your points are valid. They fail when applied to alcohol, 
which is a mind-altering substance just dangerous (if not more so) as 
currently criminalized mind-altering substances. Your admonition to stop
 comparing this to prohibition is also invalid, since ease of production
 and transportation have little to do with black market availability. 
Profit is the basic motive here, and production and transportation 
issues will not stop a lucrative market from being accessed via the 
black market.</p><p>By your reasoning, alcohol should be...</p><p>1) ..criminalized, since many 15 year-olds have died as a direct result of consuming this drug.</p><p>2)...readily available on the black market today.</p><p>3) ...resulting in slow cash flow for corporations and the "Gub-mint" due to the use of the DEA as an enforcement branch.</p><p>4) ...again, criminalized, since children have access to money.</p><p>The
 fact that none of these things are true serves to illustrate not only 
the invalidity of your points, but also the hypocrisy engrained within 
the popular view that alcohol is somehow fundamentally different from 
illegal drugs. The current punitive-based war on drugs is an expensive 
failure by any measure, and needs to be ended.</p>

<p>@ePoch270 - You missed one minor point.  FBI statistics show 80 
percent of all illegal drug transactions are of marijuana.  We ARE 
re-legalizing it.  Once we do, 80 percent of the "problem" will be 
solved and the public will lose their propaganda-induced hysteria and be
 ready to deal with the hard drugs in a rational way.  -  That doesn't 
included putting people in jail for them.  That just makes things worse.</p>

<p>the fact is that law enforcement seize anywhere from 5 to 10% of 
illegal drug in our countries i know plenty of businesses that would be 
real happy with 5 to 10% loss , just think of vegetable producers , 
somewhere i believe that the war on drugs is just a smokescreen to make 
politicians look good , and i wouldn't even be surprised that some if 
not most get campaign financing from the drug lords and are therefore 
have no intention of a) ending the speudo war on drugs or b) legalising 
anything</p>

<p>This war on drugs has left millions of American children war-torn 
without fathers in the homes to raise their sons to men, like only men 
can do, burdening society by forcing mothers to raise children in single
 parent homes, and in extreme cases, pulling grandparents out from 
retirement from parenting to raise and rear them. This war also imposes 
heavy stress on state financial resources due to these households' 
dependency on state welfare to the point of insolvency causing 
deterioration of local city school systems across America. Being a big 
city native, I've witnessed this domino effect in action first hand over
 the past 25 years, and it is quite alarming. Now these children's 
quality of life has drastically waned all in the name of the war on 
drugs.</p><p>I remember watching television when the war on drugs was 
first announced. Watching Nancy Reagan make the declaration, then, as if
 on cue, immediately afterwards there was a massive cocaine bust right 
across the street from the white house involving hundreds of kilos 
stacked six feet high for the reporters to photograph. It had to be 
*one* of Washington's depos where all of K Street went to get wholesale 
prices. They probably never missed it. Legalization through taxation is 
the only way this pseudo war will ever end. Around the world there are 
plausible models on legalization to follow if the US government truly 
wants to stop running in place with this exercise in futility. Yet I 
know better to think the US government will ever want to stop an 
empowering money train that has help build immortal tentacle after 
immortal tentacle.</p>

<p>Tighter restrictions on drug policies gives more control to federal 
entities who in turn expend their DoJ operating budgets on surveillance 
programs, then ask for more. If budgets are not expended then they are 
cut. DEA has to justify its budget by successful busts. More states are 
legalizing marijuana due to public concensus. States are also realizing 
the potential tax revenue on legal marijuana. It is a win/win for states
 and public.</p>

unborn child and even extends so far as to prevent doctors, nurses and 
drug companies from being prosecuted for helping them, but somehow 
people still don't have a right to their own bodies that would allow 
them to accept some risk to their own bodies and get a little high 
sometimes?</p><p>My body, my right.  I don't do drugs, but it is no business of the government if I choose to.</p>

<p>The war on drugs is an illegal war of profit. The very basis of 
federal laws making these drugs illegal is sketchy at best and is 
contrary to the powers given to states by the constitution. The states 
never gave the federal government the power to regulate drugs.</p>

<p>This is why any money seized or gathered or fined-by any group should
 NOT be given to that group.  It forms a positive-reinforced-loop that 
warps the original authorization of the group.  Any money seized or 
fined should go directly to pay down national debt.</p><p>"But Soghoian 
also argues that the use of surveillance to bust drug dealers feeds on 
itself. Cops or DEA agents who take down a narcotics trafficking group 
often seize millions of dollars in assets. “When agencies bust a drug 
dealer and get $5 million and a kilo of coke, they keep the money,” 
Soghoian says. “Surveillance is expensive…In many ways, the drug cases 
subsidize the surveillance technology used by law enforcement.”"</p>

<p>May 13, 2014 JUST SAY NO...to the War on Drugs</p><p>Every day, more 
Americans agree the War on Drugs has failed and must change. The Smarter
 Sentencing Act will save billions of dollars and ease dangerous 
overcrowding in prisons by reducing sentences for non-violent drug 
offenders. It will also help strengthen communities and reduce racial 
injustice. Ask your members of Congress to pass the Smarter Sentencing 
Act.

 2.4 million people live behind bars in America — the highest number in 
the world. That's a little more than 0.7% of the population and more 
than 700 for every 100,000 people.  This world map illustrates how 
disconcerting that is.  The size of each country corresponds to the size
 of its total prison population (as of 2010), and a darker color 
indicates a higher incarceration rate. The area of the U.S. is bigger 
than China, a country that dwarfs the U.S. general population by more 
than four times. Also note how tiny Canada looks next to the U.S.</p><p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/world-map-of-incarceration-rates-2014-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.businessinsider.com...</a></p>

<p>Legalization could make a lot of money as well. but large systems are
 hard to change, and any establishment will fight change.  Law 
enforcement (and military) are especially proficient at fighting change,
 because of the power they already wield.   We haven't established a 
very good check on that power.  <br>The US is lucky to have states that 
have the courage to try new things, blaze new trails.  Without them, the
 country would wither.</p>

<p>the drug problem has never been a problem.  some people may have problems, but that's a totally different thing. <br>Some
 people abuse religion and do very bad things.  Some abuse cars and do 
very bad things. So the logic behind drugs being illegal isn't 
consistent. the question then is, why?</p><p>Here's one answer I've considered. Follow me on this bit of devils advocacy..<br>Making
 something that people want illegal, creates a black market.  A 
widespread black market needs a large powerful law enforcement 
establishment to keep it in check.  What happens to the enforcement 
establishment if it's enemy shrinks, it would shrink as well.  Now, what
 happens if a large threat to the citizenry develops, but law 
enforcement is in a shrunken state? Vulnerability, maybe an unacceptable
 amount.   You can apply that to military force as well.  Unless the 
force is actively fighting an enemy somewhere it becomes weak.<br>I 
could argue, that we may be better off having something like drugs stay 
illegal so that law enforcement stays funded to a highly capable level. 
 If cops can't arrest drug dealers, who will they be busy arresting?</p>
