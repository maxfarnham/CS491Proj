<p>Women aren't in engineering or science fields because they're told 
from a young age that science, math, and engineering are "boy things". 
They are not turning away from those fields of their own free will. 
They're being pressured to fit gender roles.</p><p>From a very young 
age, girls are told not to pursue careers in those fields because those 
jobs aren't "feminine" enough, girls are told that they can't do math 
and science because they're "too emotional", and that they aren't as 
smart as men.</p><p>Women are constantly questioned in the workplace on 
whether they know what they are doing. People don't expect women to know
 anything about "manly" fields, and are thus frequently overlooked for 
leadership positions, or even for basic advice and information. Women 
aren't expected to be able to provide valuable input.</p><p>Saying women
 are turning away from computer science of their own free wills is like 
saying that evacuating your house because of a wildfire is really just 
you deciding to move somewhere with cooler weather.</p>

<p>How much does the US waste educating women who take up valuable space
 at universities only to leave work to have babies and never return, 
living from the incomes of their husbands?</p><p>Be glad few women enter
 fields like engineering and more focus on things like cooking, sewing, 
gardening, cleaning, piano, flute, etc. they can use at home to nurture 
and entertain the family.</p><p>After decades of suppressing the 
achievements of boys (ie the future generation of those who built this 
country), reports that in some states are seeing more women then men 
entering higher eduction should be cause for alarm rather then some 
moronic girl power statement.</p>

<p>If your comment were true, that women are turning from STEM fields 
because of the gender roles that are being hammered into them, did it 
suddenly get worse? Notice, they were a higher proportion in the 70s/80s
 than today. Did the patriarchy suddenly ratchet up the propaganda?</p><p>If
 anything, what's happened is women started trickling into those fields 
and found out they didn't like them. STEM fields, technology in 
particular, are high-workload, high stress fields. There are no long 
vacations. And, as other articles have discussed, for instance in game 
development, there is no stability. Entire swaths of programmers 
routinely get laid off once projects are cancelled. Studies show that 
women, more so than men, value career stability, even at the sacrifice 
of more money. They also value career choices that allow them to do 
things outside of work.</p>

<p>Everyone's entitled to his or her opinion and we all engage in 
speculation on matters outside our expertise. Would you defer to the 
findings of a social science researcher like Dr. Jane Margolis who has 
studied this exact phenomenon or would you rather sit pat on your own 
observations/gut feelings and the handful of semi-related articles 
you've read? This chart argues against your trickle theory. Note that 
the number of female physical science majors and medical school students
 increased while female computer science majors declined. <br><a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/17/356944145/episode-576-when-women-stopped-coding" rel="nofollow">http://www.npr.org/blogs/money...</a></p>

<p>I'll see your anecdote with an anecdote of a female math prodigy who 
was subtly persuaded to drop her computer science major at Johns Hopkins
 in 1984. A researcher at Carnegie-Mellon noticed the declining numbers 
of female computer science graduates, studied the causes, and almost 
reversed the trend there. The math prodigy who had become a foreign 
languages major went back to college ten years later and earned a PhD in
 Computer Science, which she now teaches. She had the nature the whole 
time--she just suffered from an unlevel playing field. The 17 minute 
audio has additional anecdotes and the web page has a graph showing the 
trend. I don't have daughters and maybe you're not open to more 
info/anecdotes/data/hypotheses but I'll give you the benefit of the 
doubt. <br><a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/17/356944145/episode-576-when-women-stopped-coding" rel="nofollow">http://www.npr.org/blogs/money...</a></p>

<p>"Clinton To Make Gender Issues Key to Presidential Bid"</p><p>Hillary,
 let me give you a tip:  take a big, fat page out of the Margaret 
Thatcher's playbook for starters.  Next, drop the Gender Issues bit -- 
your platform could be focused on Giraffe-mating issues and the female 
voter base in the U.S. would still vote for you.  Why?  Because you're 
female.   All the Gender Issues-thing is going to do is tick off your 
potential male voter base.</p><p>Also, steer clear of any advice from 
the homely Columbia University-type chicks so endeared to their likely 
fantasies of sexual assault. They're not helping you and will, again, 
only antagonize your male voter base. (see examples of what I am talking
 about by searching the names Emma Sulkowicz and "Jackie" at U.Va.)</p><p>I
 voted Bush senior when your husband made his run in '92.  Turns out 
Bill was a heck of a survivor and politician.  I abstained from voting 
in 2000 and 2004, but made a political change and voted for President 
Obama in 2008 and 2012.  Frankly, I intend to vote for you, Hillary, in 
2016.  Please don't lose my vote</p>

<p>Will be amusing to see all the blind support and willful ignorance

We're still waiting to hear her accomplishments as Secretary of State as

<p>I identify as liberal and I think Hillary would be a bad president. I
 volunteered for Obama and contributed over $600 to his primary campaign
 in 2008. I don't want her. But I would take her over Bush, Walker, 
Cruz, Paul, Santorum, Huckabee, Perry, Rubio, Trump, or Fiorina. To me 
it's not just some superficial student council election in which I vote 
against someone for whom I have a visceral dislike. I want a Democratic 
president and a Democrat-majority Senate in 2017 (Repubs can keep the 
House because it's hopelessly gerrymandered and because Boehner is inept
 and that's how I like my Republicans). Hillary Clinton is a lying 
politician who will work to strengthen Social Security, Medicare, and 
public education. She will do a workmanlike job on the economy and she 
will (for some reason) treat Israel like we owe them something. The 
Republican candidate (whoever that turns out to be) will work to cut 
Social Security, turn Medicare into Vouchercare, and privatize public 
education. He (because it will be a he) will push for trickle-down 
economics which has always failed to trickle and he will (for some 
reason) treat Israel like it's our boss.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. The house is safe for those on the left as long
 as John Boehner stays in, lamest, most spineless house speaker EVER!</p><p>I
 wonder if any dems are going to provide a serious challenge to Hillary.
 To be honest I kind of hope not, she is our perfect candidate to run 
against. I will also say this. If a Republican was running with a record
 and character like Hillary's, I would vote third party. I could not 
hold my nose for someone as scandal ridden, fake, and a total political 
creature like Ms. Clinton.</p>
