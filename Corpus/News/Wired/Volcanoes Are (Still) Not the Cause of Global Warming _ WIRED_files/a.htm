The answer is, of course, yes.  But no working scientist today should be subject to criticism for accepting, without question, that atoms exist.

To question these climate science results would mean to also question the results of other fields that also rest on the same well-established science.\n\nFor example, I was having a debate with another commenter recently about the correctness of the greenhouse gas theory.  The ideas of the greenhouse gas theory rest on well-established results of physics, such as why and how molecules absorb and radiate IR radiation.  If one is going to undermine the greenhouse gas theory, you're going to have to undermine some very basic quantum mechanics.

No, of course not.

<p>There is no question that we are to blame but the author should be 
more clear.  One, they should stick to the same units in all comparisons
 so as not to confuse.  Two, 44% is not a "drop in the bucket", it's 
almost half. Make your case but don't confiscate.</p>

<p>I guess we weren't supposed to pay too much attention to the actual 
numbers.  The statistics used (still) don't make the author's case.  If 
you look carefully, you will notice the yearly volcano total is not 
given in the same units as the yearly US transportation sector total.  
Once they are converted to lbs, you get 5.7 x 10^11, and 1.1 x 10^12, 
and the ratio is 52%!  He strengthened the car emissions in the second 
part to make car emissions larger, instead of using the given value for 
the entire US transportation sector.   The rest is simple.  Give it a 
cheeky title, rely on the fact that most readers hate math, and you have
 your case.  If you ask me, volcanoes emitting more than half of the 
amount of CO2 of the entire US transportation sector in 2009 is 
significant.  It is unscientific to give sensational titles and hard 
opinions.  The data is the data.  It doesn't care what title you give 
it, and what your opinion of it is.</p>

<p>Huebsch made the following comment during his confirmation hearing:</p><p></p><blockquote>I
 believe that humans can have an impact to climate change, but I don’t  
think it’s anywhere near the level of impact of just the natural 
progression of our planet,” Huebsch said. “You know, the elimination of 
 essentially every automobile would be offset by one volcano exploding. 
 You have to recognize the multiple factors that go into climate change.</blockquote><p></p><p><a href="http://www.wrn.com/2015/04/huebsch-queried-on-climate-change/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wrn.com/2015/04/hue...</a></p><p>To investigate this statement, <u>the only comparison that is required</u>
 is to compare a single volcanoe's CO2 output to the CO2 output of every
 single automobile.  I am guessing that number for the CO2 output of 
every car the world over is unavailable (or the author didn't want to 
dig it up), so what is substituted is that of all US cars.</p><p>Now you
 are correct that the author messes up his math.  If I compare the 
largest eruption for Kilauea to that of US autos, I get 0.00006.  For 
that of Pinatubo, I get 0.99.</p><p>Regardless of the author's math mistakes though, <u>this analysis does disprove Huebsch's statement.</u></p><p>It
 is end-of-story at this point.  To make a comparison against an average
 year's worth of volcanoe's CO2 output is unnecessary.  However it does 
make it interesting since it allows one to make the further statement 
that <i>even if we look at the <u>high end</u> of volcano CO2 output for
 a year, and compare it against only US car CO2 emissions, we find that 
it is still approximately 2 to 1 in favor of the cars.</i></p><p>And 
finally, based upon the link the author provided for the US car 
emissions figure, one can see that in 2009, car CO2 emissions made up 
about 1/3 of the total US emissions (505.7/1485.4).  This pushes the 
high end total volcano output comparison down to 17%.  We can already 
see that once we begin to factor in the rest of the world, this number 
will fall far below 10%.</p><p>Thus, the author's title is justified and not sensational.</p>

<p>Thanks, I didn't know the volcano guy made those claims, and it makes
 sense that the author would pick that assertion. Scientific questions 
that (still) need attention.  Are CO2 emissions increasing temp, or are 
increasing temps increasing CO2?  Correlation does not equal causation. 
 Why are official "adjustments" to the temp records always up?  Why 
haven't they ever adjusted the record down?  What would the temp record 
look like without human influenced "adjustments?"  Why is CO2 in the 
Jurassic Period so much higher than today?  It is convenient to look at 
the last few thousands of years, but things fall apart pretty fast when 
you try and explain millions of years.  It points to the fragility of 
the models.  What are the assumptions made by these computer models that
 give us 99% certainty that humans are responsible for temp increases? 
We need to question everything, or we are not doing science.  In fact, 
many "scientists" on here are starting to sound like Climate Change 
Evangelicals!  Ha, just kidding folks, but sort of not, think about it.</p>

<p>I appreciate the reply.</p><p>You are absolutely correct that we 
should question things.  But that also leads to a question: when do we 
attain a level of satisfaction with an explanation to the extent that we
 can move beyond the questions it answers?  For instance, you may find 
this a ridiculous example, but I think it drives home the point I want 
to make.  My example is: is it OK, today, to question the atomic nature 
of matter?  The answer is, of course, yes.  But no working scientist 
today should be subject to criticism for accepting, without question, 
that atoms exist.  At this stage, the atomic nature of matter is 
well-established: it is <i>settled</i>.</p><p>Now I know that most 
global warming skeptical folk don't like to hear that word as it 
conjures up images of scientists stifling inquiry.  But to me that is 
not what settled means.  To me it means that there exist results of 
climate science that rest on well-established science.  To question 
these climate science results would mean to also question the results of
 other fields that also rest on the same well-established science.</p><p>For
 example, I was having a debate with another commenter recently about 
the correctness of the greenhouse gas theory.  The ideas of the 
greenhouse gas theory rest on well-established results of physics, such 
as why and how molecules absorb and radiate IR radiation.  If one is 
going to undermine the greenhouse gas theory, you're going to have to 
undermine some very basic quantum mechanics.  One indeed might be 
successful at that, but then again...</p><p>All of this is a very long 
winded way to finally come around to your multiple questions about the 
"adjustments" to the temperature record.  Now I'll be the first to say 
that these adjustments fall into a different category from those of 
quantum mechanics.  But, questions surrounding the adjustments have been
 asked and answered time and again.  At this point I don't fault climate
 scientists who are knowledgeable about these adjustments to consider 
the point settled.</p><p>Does that mean that someone won't find an 
error, or figure out a superior way to handle the issues that surround 
the raw temperature data?  No, of course not.  But I do think that 
enough analysis of these adjustments have been made, so that working 
climate scientists can confidently use the temperature records in other 
research.</p><p>A very good overview of the adjustments and their impacts to temperature records can be found here:</p><p><a href="http://judithcurry.com/2015/02/09/berkeley-earth-raw-versus-adjusted-temperature-data/" rel="nofollow">http://judithcurry.com/2015/02...</a></p><p>In
 case you need some background info, the authors of this piece are 
associated with a group called Berkeley Earth.  They too had serious 
scientific questions about the temperature record so they formed their 
own group and did an entirely independent analysis, using different 
approaches to adjustments than those used by others, such as the NOAA.  
I'll let the essay speak for itself.</p><p>If this weren't so long already I'd address your other questions too.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.  But I’m not going to attempt to explain 
anything.  The reason: I can’t.  Does that admission surprise you?  It 
shouldn’t.  I am a scientist, but I’m not a climate scientist.  And 
while obtaining the raw data from the various temperature stations in 
question is probably easy enough, I don’t have access to the computer 
algorithms used to make the adjustments.  And I don’t want to spend the 
time doing the analysis.</p><p>And I trust the scientific enterprise.  I trust that science is self-correcting.</p><p>And
 a great example of why I have this trust is exactly related to the 
temperature data.   The Berkeley Earth group, as I explained, were a 
group of skeptics.  As I stated, they had real, scientific questions 
about the accuracy of the temperature record.  So, they formed their own
 group and did their own analysis – completely independent of NOAA, NASA
 and CRU.  And what did they find?  The same answer as NOAA, NASA and 
CRU.</p><p><u>That is science at work.</u>   <u>That is how science is done.</u></p><p>I urge you to read about them:</p><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Earth" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B...</a></p><p>And visit their website:</p><p><a href="http://berkeleyearth.org/" rel="nofollow">http://berkeleyearth.org/</a></p><p>Their papers are very readable.</p><p>Now you don’t have to have this same trust that I have claimed for myself above.  That’s OK – I won’t try to convince you of it.</p><p>But as a scientist, I <b>do</b>
 demand published scientific evidence of problems with the adjustments, 
not the writings of journalists or bloggers, to change my mind.  I hope 
you will show me the same respect and not try to convince me otherwise.</p>

<p>"Atmospheric physicist Dr. Murry Salby: Man-made CO2 could only cause warming of 'a few tenths of a degree, if at all'</p><p>A
 recent seminar presentation by atmospheric physicist &amp; professor 
Murry Salby in Germany strikes another huge blow to climate alarm, 
demonstrating:</p><p>The man-made share of CO2 in the atmosphere is only
 a maximum of 30% (0-30%). The remainder is related to temperature 
changes, natural outgassing from the oceans, and to humidity.</p><p>The residence time of CO2 in the atmosphere is only 4-7 years, not hundreds of years as falsely claimed by the IPCC Bern model.</p><p>Man-made
 CO2 emissions increased a whopping 350% faster since 2002, yet the rate
 of CO2 increase in the atmosphere remained steady at ~2.1 ppm/yr, a 
"strong indication that anthropogenic emissions can not have a 
significant or even dominant share."</p><p>His conclusion: "Because of 
the saturation effect in the energy absorption of CO2 molecules with 
increasing concentration and short residence time, the further increase 
in temperature could be therefore only at most a few tenths of a degree,
 if at all. However, the known fossil reserves would be exhausted by 
then."</p><p><a href="http://hockeyschtick.blogspot.com/2015/03/a-recent-seminar-presentation-by.html" rel="nofollow">http://hockeyschtick.blogspot....</a></p>

<p>You used some of the smallest volcano eruptions. You should use the 
largest,  Tambora would be a better example if some one suggests a 
single volcano exploding (rather than emitting constantly as many do) is
 greater than all autos over all time.</p>

<p>Thanks.  The author states that Pinatubo is the second largest 
eruption in the 20th century and I used Pinatubo's values in my 
comparisons.  Tambora was a larger eruption, but I don't believe that 
Pinatubo would be characterized as a small eruption.</p><p>Some put 
Pinatubo only behind Tambora and Mt. Thera in the last 500 years.  
(Whether that is arguable or not is not really important as I think it 
is safe to say that Pinatubo was a large volcanic eruption.)</p><p><a href="http://www.livescience.com/30507-volcanoes-biggest-history.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.livescience.com/305...</a></p>

<p>Yes, and…??</p><p>Oh well, I have to assume you are trying to use the
 linked article to claim that we still don’t know precisely the total 
yearly amount of CO2 exhausted by volcanoes.  Probably true.  But that 
still doesn’t make Huebsch’s<br>statement, which concerns single volcanic eruptions, correct – we know enough to analyze and falsify that.</p><p>But
 let’s dig into the LiveScience post a little deeper.  The author cites a
 2013 paper by Mike Burton as giving the most recent estimates.  The 
link is broken in the post, but it is fairly easy to find the paper she 
is referring to.  It is here (you'll have to copy and past into your 
browser):</p><p>file:///C:/Users/gslough/Downloads/2013_Burton%20et%20al_book_chapter.pdf</p><p>Now the 2011 Gerlach paper that the Wired author links to in his blog post (found here: <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011EO240001/pdf" rel="nofollow">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com...</a>
 ), gives a range for volcanic CO2 emissions of 0.13 to 0.44 gigatons, 
although they use as a working range 0.14 to 0.26 gigatons per year.  
The Burton paper gives an estimate of 0.54 gigatons per year – about 
twice the working number used by Gerlach, but not a big enough change to
 be meaningful.  In fact, Burton et al. state:</p><p><i>The global 
subaerial CO2 flux we report is higher than previous estimates, but 
remains insignificant relative to anthropogenic emissions, which are two
 orders of magnitude greater at 35,000 Mt/yr [35 gigatons per year] 
(Friedlingstein et al. 2010). Nevertheless, it is clear that 
uncertainties in volcanic CO2 emission rates remain high and significant
 upward revisions of the lithospheric CO2 flux cannot be ruled out.</i></p><p>So
 the take away is that volcanic CO2 emissions are still uncertain, but 
do not, and are not expected to, form a significant fraction of 
anthropogenic emissions.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is theoretically possible to have a mega-volcanic eruption
 that produces more CO2 than humans do, but if we did, CO2 would be the 
least of our problems.</p><p>Of course volcanoes are not causing global 
warming now, because no global warming is happening, despite the alleged
 (and likely) ongoing increase of global CO2.</p><p>The increase of 
World CO2 curve measured over the last few decades is roughly linear.  
The human produced CO2 increase in the same time is exponential, but it 
has not changed the World CO2 curve.</p><p>Thus human CO2 emissions are 
showing no impact on naturally increasing CO2, and CO2 is not causing an
 increase in temperature., therefore the effects of CO2, though real, do
 not drive world temperature.</p><p>Catastrophic global warming (though 
not correlated with CO2) did indeed happen at the beginning of this 
interglacial.  But this interglacial is about over, and has been cooling
 slowly for 3K years.   The most likely climate challenge facing 
humanity now is catastrophic cooling, back to Earth's normal glaciated 
state in this era, popularly called an ice age.</p>

<p>If you need and want evidence a short course in paleoclimatology would be in order.</p><p>Short
 of that, the periodicity of the ice age climate cycle for the last 
million years has been ~100K yrs and appears to be slowly lengthening 
with a warm interglacial portion (like now) that averages 10K yrs.  This
 current interglacial is less warm than the last and already longer than
 the 10K yr average.  The 65N insolation has dropped to a level that 
typically presages a shift to glaciation.</p><p>To (over) simplify, we 
are in the position of a man who has just experienced an unusually hot 
November, who is looking at ways of improving his cooling system, 
instead of preparing for winter.  The difference is that an ice age is 
much more deadly than the worst current winter.. Less than 10 million 
humans survived the last one.</p><p>The current state of the CRF, solar 
wind, EMF, magnetic pole alignment and solar cycles all suggest a sharp 
upcoming cooling.  We simply do not know enough to predict if this 
cooling leads directly to ice age conditions, or if another (likely 
weaker) warm period occurs first.</p>

<p>The 1991 Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines was the second largest 
eruption during the twentieth century.  The largest eruption during that
 century was the 1912 Novarupta eruption in Alaska.  The Novarupta 
eruptions was ~30 times more powerful than the 1980 Mt. St. Helens 
eruption. The two largest eruptions during the nineteenth century were 
the 1815 Tambora eruption and 1883 Krakatoa eruption, and both were 
bigger than the Novarupta and Pinatubo eruptions.</p>

<p>You know that there are more cars in the world than just in the US? 
FYI in China alone there are ALSO 150 million cars. And that number is 
rising a lot (up to 10% per year). Worldwide there are at least 800 
million cars (2007), currently closer to 900 million. It would need a 
lot of volcano-eruptions to beat the emissions from all those cars (and 
light trucks). Also don't forget that emission-rules outside the US are 
way lower (think of what old bangers drive around in South-America, in 
Russia, in Africa and Asia.</p>

<p>Opinions are opinions, not science. Representing opinions as science 
on the other hand is a no no. The key here is that while it may be a 
significant portion it is not entirely responsible. Furthermore there 
are definitely a fair share of people out there that don't believe in 
climate change at all, regardless of the potential sources of greenhouse
 gases.</p>

<p>the evidence suggest no warming.  So, this is far from a fully 
developed theory.  If you predicted no change you'd more accurate than 
any of the global warming predictions, which have never been right, and 
they have to go back and hedge, rather than do more real research.  
There are many cycles involved, and we clearly don't understand all the 
factors yet.   Again, if you can't predict and model accurately, you're 
not doing science yet</p>

<p>Warmers also disregard the recent little ice age when they talk about
 temperatures moving in only one direction. Of course it's warmer now 
than it was a few hundred years ago. We're in an interglacial period. 
It's not as simple as just preventing short term warming as we'll have 
an even bigger problem when the next ice age hits. (They happen 
relatively suddenly after a high temperature peak.)</p>

<p>Current evidence shows that ice ages last ~100,000 years, and 
interglacials (warm ages) last ~15,000-20,000 years. When heat peaks it 
melts all the ice sheets, causing global cooling and significantly 
increased precipitation in higher latitudes like a rubber band effect. 
The transition into an ice age is relatively sudden. Current estimates 
expect that humans can hold back the next ice age for ~50,000 years with
 current terraforming technology.</p>

<p>You failed to notice that he was comparing ALL of the volcanos in the
 world to just the car in the UNITED STATES. USA cars are only 20% of 
the world total. cars are responsible for less than 1% of human produced
 CO2 emissions. Coal burning power plants 43%, 36% oil used in heating 
and power plants, and 20% from natural gas being burned. Thus ALL of the
 volcanos in the world add up to 52% (you are right on the math) of 20% 
of 1% of the CO2 emmitted by humans or roughly 0.1% of the amount 
generated by humans burning fossil fuels. This doesn't even add in the 
amounts produced by humans in other ways</p>

<p>Absolutely correct. Reporting like this is what fuzzes the issue. 
Mixing and matching units (and even measuring systems) can only be to 
cause confusion. As you said, 44% is almost half, so clearly not 'a drop
 in the bucket'.</p><p>Very poor Wired. I expect better of you.</p>

<p>I think the "drop in the bucket" statement refers mainly to one 
volcano.  The story indicates that the spokesperson said all that was 
needed was "a single eruption" to offset all the CO2 that cars emit.  
But, as shown, compared to the CO2 output of cars in the US, the CO2 
output of single volcano is truly only a "drop in the bucket".</p>
