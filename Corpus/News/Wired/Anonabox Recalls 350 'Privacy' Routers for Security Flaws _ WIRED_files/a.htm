Therefore lasting privacy solutions have to be more political than technological. \nMy particular take in the case of Anonabox is it kinda proves the general point. Even when encryption works as intended, it locks users into circles of secrecy all using the same technology. Encryption, for the foreseeable future, is incompatible with open e-commerce and life on line in general. But encryption hardly ever works as intended. It's terribly brittle, so even if you make secrecy your prime privacy strategy, you have to plan for the scenario of encryption failing. You still need regulatory safeguards to protect personal data when it falls into the wrong hands. \n A more robust privacy paradigm than everyone-for-themselves PETs is Data Protection regulations. In 100-odd countries, DP laws protect personal data against misuse even when it comes from the public domain. Remember the Google StreetView Wi-Fi collection episode? That was resolved in favour of the plaintiffs within weeks in Australia, Korea, Japan, Holland and elsewhere, because the DP laws there restrict the use of personal data even if sniffed from unencrypted \"public\" transmissions (I note that in the US, after three years the case is still in the courts, because there is no broad based privacy law). The point being that even when you lose control of your data, you can still expect privacy.

<p>It is not merely pedantic to point out that encryption products are 
not privacy enhancing technologies; they are secrecy technologies.</p><p>Privacy
 is different from secrecy. Privacy is about restraint; it is about 
limiting the personal data that is collected, limiting what is done with
 data once collected, and being open with people about what data you 
have about them. You can have privacy without secrecy.</p><p>Indeed, 
privacy is the protection you need precisely when your data is not 
secret. And the users of products like Anonabox had best remember this 
because sooner or later, their encryption is going to break down, and 
then what are they going to do? Secrecy is brittle - it cannot be relied
 upon. We need privacy regulations rather than futile, do-it-yourself 
pseudo privacy tech.</p>

<p>Steve - you have a slightly different take on a much discussed topic.
 Traditionally it is the difference between security and anonymity that 
needs to be spelled out. That's been done to death elsewhere (not that 
anyone listens) but in the context of your argument It's fair to say 
that if you want to keep a secret you need privacy.</p><p>There appears 
to be a wholesale assault on privacy being conducted by the digital 
advertising industry and the combined forces of most governments. A 
world where one can't be expected to keep a secret for technical reasons
 is badly broken. Thankfully it is still possible to achieve a degree of
 privacy if you are technically adept.</p><p>Many people think it needs to be a lot easier unless we are to abandon the concept of "confidence" altogether.</p>

<p>Thanks Adrian. <br>My take is that privacy in general is less about 
what is done with personal information than what is not done with it. 
Therefore lasting privacy solutions have to be more political than 
technological. <br>My particular take in the case of Anonabox is it 
kinda proves the general point. Even when encryption works as intended, 
it locks users into circles of secrecy all using the same technology. 
Encryption, for the foreseeable future, is incompatible with open 
e-commerce and life on line in general. But encryption hardly ever works
 as intended. It's terribly brittle, so even if you make secrecy your 
prime privacy strategy, you have to plan for the scenario of encryption 
failing. You still need regulatory safeguards to protect personal data 
when it falls into the wrong hands. <br> A more robust privacy paradigm 
than everyone-for-themselves PETs is Data Protection regulations. In 
100-odd countries, DP laws protect personal data against misuse even 
when it comes from the public domain. Remember the Google StreetView 
Wi-Fi collection episode? That was resolved in favour of the plaintiffs 
within weeks in Australia, Korea, Japan, Holland and elsewhere, because 
the DP laws there restrict the use of personal data even if sniffed from
 unencrypted "public" transmissions (I note that in the US, after three 
years the case is still in the courts, because there is no broad based 
privacy law). The point being that even when you lose control of your 
data, you can still expect privacy. Privacy is what you need when your 
affairs are not anonymous.<br>Of course, Data Protection laws are not perfect, but neither is any encryption product.</p>

<p>I appreciate and agree with your point: It must be illegal for 
someone to acquire information from me that I consider private and those
 laws must be respected in the event that it happens "by mistake". The 
problem arises when you introduce criminals into the equation who don't 
respect the law. We are all "tied in" to encryption technology in this 
sense. In fact, far from being incompatible with it, very strong 
encryption is prerequisite to being able to conduct e-commerce at all.</p><p>For
 the main part nobody has the technical resources to break the privacy 
tools we currently have if they are used properly - Anonabox just serves
 to underline that "if".</p><p>At this point it remains perfectly legal 
for me to keep secrets (I often sign contract documents that require me 
to do so) and I will continue to take all necessary steps to make it as 
difficult as possible to steal them; my responsibility to my clients 
requires that. The adversaries are formidable - our governments and 
corporations have been demonstrated to have little or no respect for my 
rights in this regard and would like to convince the public that anyone 
who wants to keep a secret ought to be considered a criminal. Ask your 
lawyer / doctor / or any other professional you deal with what their 
view of that is.</p><p>Until they start to behave themselves better, my 
colleagues and I will continue to develop methods for ordinary people to
 protect themselves from this sort of illegal abuse as cheaply and 
easily as possible.</p>

<p>I pretty well agree with all that. I spoke very loosely when I said 
'encryption was incompatible with e-commerce'. Of course SSL etc is 
essential and works well. What I had in mind was the ad hoc 
person-to-person "PETs". And I mean "e-commerce" as it exists today. We 
might re-imagine e-commerce in all sorts of ways, but experience shows 
that strong point-to-point encryption (eg secure email) is still 
utopian. I wish it were otherwise. <br>I have to say I have mixed 
feelings about my doctor encrypting records. On its face of course it's a
 good idea, but they need a high degree of expertise to manage it 
properly. It's astonishing how many small doctors' practices collapse 
from malware, or fall prey to ransomware (when a criminal encrypts the 
doctor's file servers and insists on a ransom to free the data -- why 
the hell can't these victims rebuild their system?). The sad moral is 
that small businesses are hopeless at security (for which I blame the 
technology not the businesses) so I just can't get too excited about 
encryption in real life in these environments. It tends to fail un-safe -
 either with the exposure of sensitive data, or the total loss of data.</p>

<p>Yes - it's hard to do it right. At the Cloak project won't give up 
trying though and are of the opinion that we can't do it at all without 
co-operation from the voluntary open source community. We just hope to 
make a router like this work properly - excitement is always in the eye 
of user and I sympathize with your pessimism; we're up against it.</p><p>We're
 also in agreement that public education is woefully inadequate and that
 ignorance comes at great economic cost. Better laws and a great deal 
more respect for the ones we already have should make us all happier and
 safer too.</p>

Sold as a security strategy, but it's also a constant information dump

 we have rights to your traffic.  Brilliant maneuver that's somehow

It would be less complicated if Marc Lewis / August Germar just 
published the source code themselves in accordance with the terms of the
 open source license it was released under. There is no obviously good 
reason for breaking the conditions of a free license by attempting to 
conceal source code.</p>

<p>From reading about this issue, August Germar and his friends (who 
have been very outspoken about Anonabox) would never have wasted the 
money on getting a security audit. The entire thing was built on lies 
from the get go and being done by people with little to no experience in
 anything remotely security related. The world needs something like 
Anonabox, but I don't believe we needed it from August Germar (after the
 amount of times he's lied and outright denied (valid) security claims 
made by the public). It's too bad that this project went through 
regardless. Hopefully under new management, they can make something 
worthwhile from all this, but I feel they're starting with two hands 
tied behind their back. It would have been easier for that parent 
company to just design their own product from the ground up and 
piggybacked on Anonabox's popularity.</p>

<p>My lawyer wife told me that you can't prove a negative. Thus, no one 
will ever be able to prove that they are 100% secure. Thus, no one is 
secure.</p><p>I'm sure that what Snowden told the world the NSA can do 
was probably about 10 years behind its time. Think of what the NSA has 
going on 10 stories underground in their Ultra Secure Keyscore-X 
Facility; I doubt very much Snowden had access to ALL of the programs 
the NSA works on. Dude, those guys have real-time satellite video 
surveillance with TiVo-like capabilities; need to know where that truck 
came from? Well, let's rewind 5 hours to find out. They could probably 
solve every murder right now in the US if they provided civilian access.
 Hmmm, see that 1964 Chevy Impala in downtown Los Angeles? See that 
muzzle flash while it's going down the 405? Well, if we go back 2 hours 
we can see it come from the Taqueria Mojado, then stop at 153 Gangsta 
Lane, home of the Sanchez's. You're really not in touch with technology 
if you think something like this is crazy.</p><p>It's like Area 51: The 
"alien spaceships" you see and hear about are simply military planes 
you'll see publicly in 20 years. Remember when the F117-A came out, it 
explained all the "alien spacecraft" the crazies were seeing 15 years 
beforehand?</p><p>Meet face to face if you have to plot a terrorist attack or exchange dick pics (or just show your dick right then and there).</p>

<p>probably time mismanagement, maverick hubris, and lack of experience 
contributing to lack of interest in quality assurance. Since the idea is
 good, I'd imagine some other more mature development group, or maybe 
the community will open source a more successful attempt.   <br>I 
actually think a strong open source version would be fairly simple to 
do,  given the little rasberry pi, or arduino kits that many linux 
builds.  It also probably even have all of the basic features turned on 
by default.</p>

<p>Not really a big deal, it's something that's easily fixed. It seems 
like there's motivated trolls out to destroy Anonabox. There has been a 
campaign waged against them since Kickstarter by competitors and low

inventing it first...</p>

<p>It isn't an invention.

 - sadly it won't run on an off the shelf Gainstrong router. Much as we 
think that box is a great product it just doesn't have the necessary 
resources. That is why we ran Kickstarter project to raise funds for 
producing hardware that is capable of doing the job properly.</p><p>The 
fact that the Anonabox clowns successfully sucked all of the oxygen out 
of the process - ending any serious technical debate in the process - 
proves nothing except that clowns are entertaining.</p><p>We think this 
is a big deal, partly because we've done a lot of hard work and have 
earned our opinion that the problems Lars identified are NOT easily 
fixed by the amateurs that created them, but mostly because we actually 
care about privacy.</p><p>If that makes us trolls I wish there were more about and less of whatever you are.</p>

<p>You're simply mistaken.</p><p>We 'came up' with a hardware router ( <a href="https://reclaim-your-privacy.com/2014/10/20/development-history/" rel="nofollow">https://reclaim-your-privacy.c...</a>
 ) that overcomes some of the technical problems anyone will have trying
 to get Tor to work securely on the Gainstrong device. Anonabox 
delivered the Gainstrong device and claimed they designed it. They also 
passed off poorly implemented open source firmware without any useful 
contribution to the work and have made clumsy efforts to occlude that 
fact from their customers. The Cloak project on the other hand does make
 a useful contribution that is publicly accessible. The project is also 
careful to identify any original work. We continue to fix any issues 
with Cloak that we or anyone else identifies and are grateful for all 
contributions.</p><p>Furthermore, we extracted the source (including 20 
lines of 'original' code that could have been written in 1) from the 
Anonabox device thereby providing damning evidence in support of the 
theory that Anonabox is at best honest rubbish and at worst a blatant 
scam. The page has been viewed 30,000 times since Monday. That's why 
there is an article here for you to comment on.</p><p>Do you support 
Anonabox enough to buy one of these routers even though it's now 
uncontested common knowledge that they can't write code or design a 
router?</p>

software development is not something one just picks up casually.</p><p>Things programmers should never program (jokingly, sorta):<br>1) security modules<br>2) date functions</p>
