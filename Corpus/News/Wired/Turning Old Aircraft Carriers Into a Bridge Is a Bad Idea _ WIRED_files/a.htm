The current 520 had to be designed to allow for vessel traffic through a section of drawbridge mid-span, though the new one will be high enough.\u003c/p>\u003cp>At least this solution would avoid the problem the I-90 floating bridge three miles south of the 520 bridge suffered a couple of decades ago: it won't sink because one person left a maintenance hatch open on a pontoon.\u003c/p>","isSpam":false,"isHighlighted":false,"points":-1},{"parent":1966450569,"likes":0,"forum":"wired","thread":"3678337831","isApproved":true,"author":{"username":"clayfitzgerald","about":"","name":"Clay Fitzgerald","disable3rdPartyTrackers":false,"url":"","isAnonymous":false,"rep":2.111935,"profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/clayfitzgerald/","reputation":2.111935,"location":"","isPrivate":false,"isPrimary":true,"joinedAt":"2014-04-22T04:07:35","id":"104138971","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/clayfitzgerald.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/10413/8971/avatar32.jpg?1398140509"},"isCustom":true,"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/clayfitzgerald.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/10413/8971/avatar92.jpg?1398140509","large":{"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/clayfitzgerald.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/10413/8971/avatar92.jpg?1398140509"}}},"media":[],"isFlagged":false,"dislikes":0,"raw_message":"Actually the total length of that bridge is 7,578 ft, not 2 miles (10,560 ft.)","createdAt":"2015-04-14T17:17:43","id":"1967154906","depth":1,"numReports":0,"isDeleted":false,"isEdited":true,"message":"\u003cp>Actually the total length of that bridge is 7,578 ft, not 2 miles (10,560 ft.)\u003c/p>","isSpam":false,"isHighlighted":false,"points":0},{"parent":null,"likes":0,"forum":"wired","thread":"3678337831","isApproved":true,"author":{"username":"msairs","about":"","name":"m sairs","disable3rdPartyTrackers":false,"url":"","isAnonymous":false,"rep":1.238962,"profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/msairs/","reputation":1.238962,"location":"","isPrivate":false,"isPrimary":true,"joinedAt":"2014-10-26T06:37:39","id":"127310499","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/msairs.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1428955678/images/noavatar32.png"},"isCustom":false,"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/msairs.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1428955678/images/noavatar92.png","large":{"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/msairs.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/1428955678/images/noavatar92.png"}}},"media":[],"isFlagged":false,"dislikes":1,"raw_message":"How can the author say that this bridge is not affordable without stating any projections of the cost?

<p>This is so shortsighted - probably written by one of those glass half
 empty people.  Think of the advantages.  The bridge would be protected 
by a Phalanx gun system providing near perfect protection against 
terrorist assault from the air.  For more distant threats there’s Sea 
Sparrow. Small Planes would be able to land on the roadstead and 
passengers and plane conveyed to the restaurant by elevator without 
getting out.  And as for traffic tie ups, how can you beat the ability 
to catapult a 45,000 lb truck to 165 mph in about 300 ft?  You’d 
probably need a catapult officer but we can always use another shovel 
ready job.</p>

<p>What a terrible idea for many reasons. The biggest reason its a dumb 
idea though (which is strangely not mentioned in the article), is that 
US carriers have a nuclear reactors. Thus the carrier needs to be 
partially dismantled in the first place just to remove the reactors for 
safety reasons. This is why the USS Enterprise (CVN-65) couldn't be made
 into a museum ship. So if its not cost effective to make it a museum 
ship, it certainly isn't cost effective to make such carriers into 
bridges.</p>

<p>The article doesn't really have any meat, its mostly opinion.  
Because of the heavy personal opinion of why this is "all wrong", it 
fails to even mention the name of the carriers in question.</p><p>Of the
 3 that are anchored there (Independence, Ranger, and Kitty Hawk), NONE 
are nuclear powered.  With no reactors, the cost to make them safer is 
much much lower.  But in the end, there is more money to be made by 
scrapping them then selling or giving them away as museums.  Plus, its 
near impossible to find anyone or any entity with deep enough pockets or
 waterways to support hosting a US Navy carrier, nuclear or not.</p>

<p>This is what our sh!tty banana republic has come to.</p><p>The only 
thing we spend money on are weapons systems so we can fight thirty-eight
 simultaneous wars and maintain our crucial military presence in 
Obscurabad, Somewheresistan, and Ouroilnotyoursia. We ship our 
hand-me-down weapons systems to our domestic police force so they can 
surveil or slaughter. We recycle dinosaur weapons into bridges to 
replace the crumbling infrastructure that is neglected because we're 
buying weapons to fight enemies who don't exist.</p><p>The most telling 
and successful strike against Americans in recent years? A handful of 
guys with about fifty dollars worth of boxcutters. How are aircraft 
carriers supposed to fight them? So, do we stop making nuclear subs and 
aircraft carriers? No. We pick a fight with Russia over their own 
legitimate territory, Crimea, just so we can go back to our free 
spending days during the Cold War. Does it bring us closer to nuclear 
war? Who cares? "Defense" contractors gotta move product.</p><p>So, 
where to put all of our homeless? In old tanks and nuclear subs. Where 
do we house our prisoners? On military bases. Where should we build more
 schools? In nuclear silos.</p><p>This effing country is a clown nation 
of idiots and religious children. The rest of the planet is entirely 
correct to fear and loathe the United States. We're easily the most 
dangerous nation on Earth.</p><p>If the religious right has their way, 
maybe we can put a male and female from every species on a single 
aircraft carrier. But just make sure they're different genders. Wouldn't
 want to have two male koalas performing their preverted preversions on 
our sacred American ark/yacht as it sails our plutocrats to Dubai.</p>

<p>The objections to this have nothing to do with rights being infringed
 on. It's about another idiotic example of the government wasting 
people's tax dollars like a drunk lottery winner. They endlessly come to
 people with sad stories about lower than expected revenues and pretty 
please can we raise taxes again? Oh yeah, if you don't let us raise 
taxes we'll have to start firing cops and closing fire stations. 
Meanwhile they merrily blow $90,000 to investigate colossally bad ideas 
like this.</p>

<p>Well first you need to hire people to form a committee. That 
committee then discusses which consultants to hire. Then you hire those 
consultants. The consultants invariably will need to be brought in from 
across the country, so you're paying for their travel, room, and board. 
Then the consultants look at your idea, and spend a couple of weeks 
drawing up a nice spreadsheet with lots of pretty graphs telling you why
 it won't work, or what needs to be changed to make it work. (All 
something they could have done via email) then you bring in other 
consultants to investigate the recommended changes, and produce another 
pretty set of charts.</p><p>The number of people the government can get 
involved in these things and what they can and do charge is pretty 
impressive in a sick sort of way...</p>

<p>The 90,000$ is just to see how and if it could be done. You're not 
accounting for the actual cost of building it. If the state of 
Washington has some cash laying around I say let Washingtonians decide 
if they will let it happen. Not some kneejerk reactionary libertarians.</p>

<p>How long will we continue to build monuments to WWII, anyway? And, 
uh, this just in: The US was not the only Allied (i.e. victorious) army.
 Do we need to keep proclaiming that we won the war single-handedly? 
Maybe a monument to what caused the war in the first place. It's more 
important to get those facts out - how not to impoverish a nation so 
that it has no choice but to make war - than to celebrate the 
achievement of victory. In war, no one really wins. One side just loses 
less.</p><p>How many bridges could be built with the steel from those 
two ships? Has to be the most inefficient use of steel ever. Also, the 
ships will rust to the point where a traditional bridge will have to be 
built, anyway. Dumb, dumb, dumb.</p>

<p>It looks to me like Alex Davies must be planning a political campaign
 against Rep. Jesse Young. For all his bitching, nothing he says about 
this plan dismisses its apparent advantages relative to other means of 
building a bridge; he just says that he doesn't want to build a bridge. 
Go through his objections one by one and, except for his assertion that 
the Navy would never give carriers to the State of Washington for the 
purpose, a matter subject to political solution, each would apply at 
least equally to any other pontoon bridge.The last objection is 
particularly foolish: The bridge segments represented by the retired 
carriers would have to be linked to each other and to the shores with 
other segments which would, of course, include means of entry and egress
 for local boats. Naturally, locals would still rally around the ancient
 cry of NIMBY!, just as they did when Rome was building roads and 
aqueducts. (Alex Davies wouldn't happen to live near the proposed bridge
 site, would he?)</p>

<p>Well, if the aircraft carriers are so easily moved by wind, how do 
the active aircraft carriers are anchored down? Or you are saying that 
aircraft carriers never ever do that, as this is a difficult engineering
 task that aircraft designers never thought of?</p>

<p>Active aircraft carriers are either moored alongside a pier or 
they're anchored in a place where some drift is not a problem. Here's a 
good timelapse showing a carrier that's anchored and how much it moves. 
Note that the boats approaching it are not tugs moving it around, 
they're ferrying personnel to and from it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLHndfiTAWI" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</a></p>

<p>The article states that there are 5 floating bridges in the Puget 
Sound area; that's interesting because I know of only 3 and I've lived 
in the locale all of my life. There are 2 that cross Lake Washington 
(maybe where I-90 crosses could be considered 2 separate spans making 
the total 4) and 1 that crosses Hood Canal. Construction is currently 
under way to build a replacement for the Evergreen Point floating 
bridge, but the old one will be removed when the new one is completed. 
So, the number is 3 or maybe 4, but not 5.</p>

<p>I live in this area, and I would hate to see this. We have enough 
problems with the entrenched interests that kept the replacement 520 
floating bridge (the world's longest such bridge at two miles) from 
being 8 lanes and holding it to 6. It will replace the current 4-lane 
mess that was a mess by the late 80s with the growth we had back then. 
The current 520 had to be designed to allow for vessel traffic through a
 section of drawbridge mid-span, though the new one will be high enough.</p><p>At
 least this solution would avoid the problem the I-90 floating bridge 
three miles south of the 520 bridge suffered a couple of decades ago: it
 won't sink because one person left a maintenance hatch open on a

<p>How can the author say that this bridge is not affordable without 
stating any projections of the cost? Yes, aircraft carriers are huge

the study has even started? And with using nothing but speculation, no 
less?</p>
