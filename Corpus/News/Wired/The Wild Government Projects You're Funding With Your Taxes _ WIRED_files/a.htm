<p>I'm all about small government, but the genome data and the iris DNA 
database are the only 2 that bothers me.   Surely you could find some 
better wasteful spending than the items you listed, I'll give you a few 
examples from 2014...</p><p>- $5,210 that the State Department tried to 
spend on a blowup, human-size foosball field for an embassy in Belize.  
(thank got that got canned)<br>- $19 million in salaries to suspended government workers because of misconduct.  <br>- $50,000 spent to study whether sea monkeys’ swimming changes the flow of oceans<br>-
 $450,000 that the Homeland Security Department spent on high-end gym 
memberships for staffers whose federal health insurance already pays for
 gym benefits</p><p>just to name a few.</p>

<p>$1.5 Trillion is just federal revenue. The federal budget is over 
TWICE that, or around $3.9 Trillion. In other words, the majority of the
 federal government's spending is financed not by current tax revenues, 
but by borrowing against <i>future</i> tax revenues.</p><p>And that percentage is increasing. And servicing that debt is getting more and more expensive, as well.</p><p>So,
 yes, as you spend late nights scrounging through shoeboxes of old 
receipts (an idiotic and wasteful endeavor itself a product of a complex
 confiscatory tax system designed to intimidate), take comfort in the 
knowledge that your cash <i>and your children's and their children's cash</i> is helping Uncle Sam fund massive boondoggles and other wasteful, inefficient efforts.</p>

<p>Your $3.9T figure is pretty solid. But NOT at all clear what data you
 are using to show that "the majority of...spending is financed...by 
borrowing against future tax revenues. See this graphic, which shows 
that 15% of the President's budget proposal relies on borrowing. 
(Perhaps you use the word majority differently than I'm used to). <a href="https://static.nationalpriorities.org/images/fb101/2014/presidents-budget.png" rel="nofollow">https://static.nationalpriorit...</a></p>

<p>What the hell is everyone's problem with the genome project through 
the department of health? Really, you shouldn't be concerned that the 
genome project is using that much money but that the government is 
spending that much money on it. The government HATES science projects 
that don't benefit it directly - largely because undereducated idiots 
run government procurement programs for very important, far-reaching 
stuff without immediately obvious benefits and judge them based on their
 immediately obvious benefits or military application.</p>

<p>Absolutely nothing. Did I say there was anything wrong with it? No, I
 did not. I merely stated it is one of my favorites. Climate denier? 
Listen Cartigan, the earth undergoes cycles of change we, as human 
beings, have not been here on earth long enough to record, observe, nor 
fully understand. Are climate changes occurring? Yes. Do we know with 
100% certainty what is causing these changes? No.</p><p>Earth is in a 
state of constant cyclical flux caused by a combination of 
internal/external influences. Are all of these influences known and 
fully understood? No. There could be planetary inner core changes 
occurring directly tied to our sun's activity, and/or, an unknown 
celestial body intersecting our planet's orbit causing these changes. 
The bottom line is who knows? I don't, and neither do you.</p>

 ice cores? That the current level of climate change has met the

<p>Listen you know nothing, you don't know me. And unlike your male 
company, we don't converse.   Your reasoning, or lack thereof, is about 
as randomly structured as your analytical 'skills.' You've made dubious 
assumption after dubious assumption about me only to find yourself 
flustered. Argue  your second grade science with a like-minded audience.
 Good day.</p>
