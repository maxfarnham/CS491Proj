Insipid, I am 10-steps ahead of you.\n\n\nObama deceived me. I wasn't happy with his intention for establishing The Grey State.\n\n\nI emailed Rand Paul and he personally responded back to him; he only addressed one part of the question I asked him about GMO labeling law. He sees to support GMO and that sickens me, pretty much encouraging population control heralded by Obama and his cronies.

<p>LOL!  You're suggesting Eric Holder will act in the LAW'S interest?  
The guy who himself has lied to Congress many times under oath, 
conducted illegal operations against nominally friendly, allied 
neighbors and refused to act in the citizens' interest anytime there is a
 conflict between the abuses of his boss' party and those of ordinary 
Americans?  THAT head of the Justice Department?  THAT Eric Holder?</p><p>Oh my...that's so quaint.</p>

<p>Nice.  Keep slurping that delicious partisan knob you have your lips 
wrapped round.  Unlike many, I'm an American long before I'll identify 
myself with any political party so yes, it does grieve me that our 
current administration is setting many bad precedents by sneering at the
 rule of law and using the Constitution for their personal roll of 
asswipe.</p><p>It's equally unsurprising that such a thought would hardly think twice about coming to roost in your head.</p>

<p>You're not an enemy...you're merely insipid.  I simply have a much 
clearer grasp of history and what the current administration is doing 
and how that will allow future administrations to go "one further" 
because the current folks did.</p><p>To illustrate: your best rejoinder 
was a lame attempt to suggest that because I discern the damage that 
Holder and Obama are doing to the rule of law and separation of powers 
respectively and have the gall to say so...I am automagically somehow 
some variety of right wing brownshirt.  That, unfortunately, is the 
limit of your capacity for objective thought: if you don't like my guy 
then obviously you're a Nazi.  "Immature" and "ridiculous" doesn't 
really do your take justice but it's a solid start.  What's even more 
amusing is that you associate someone like Rand Paul with "police state"
 when, in actuality, it is Obama and Holder who have used the IRS to 
suppress free speech and go after political opponents, refused to 
enforce laws they personally disagree with (because, you know, fuck 
laws), have run guns into a neighboring country, lied to Congress on 
multiple occasions and have not only continued but greatly expanded 
federal, state and local law enforcement capabilities to spy on American
 citizens (police state anybody?).</p><p>See, to me, you're no enemy...you're merely a clueless fool with a voice and you're a dime a dozen.</p>

<p>Democrap and Repubtard are on the same side of the coin. Insipid, I am 10-steps ahead of you.</p><p>Obama deceived me. I wasn't happy with his intention for establishing The Grey State.</p><p>I
 emailed Rand Paul and he personally responded back to him; he only 
addressed one part of the question I asked him about GMO labeling law. 
He sees to support GMO and that sickens me, pretty much encouraging 
population control heralded by Obama and his cronies. Both of these 
dickwads don't care about the issues we're facing today; it's all about 
the New World Order.</p><p>At any rate, Ron Paul is pretty much a good candidate but he's old and senile - he needs to retire.</p><p>I
 won't be voting for anyone; I've sided with Anonymous - collective mind
 in a hive. That's who I am. Sorry to say, those greedy fuckers in DC 
needs to go - we gotta kick them out of politics. They have had enough 
kool-aids to drink.</p>

<p>Kim missed the most important point of the Stingray technology: By 
forcing the phone to negotiate basic encryption Stingray allow a full 
interception of the communication not only tracking the location (and 
messing the entire local network).</p><p>Is preventing the defense to 
know how the law enforcement agency obtained evidence in criminal case 
not simply illegal? This is a total perversion of basic justice where it
 is possible to charge anybody of any crime without giving any proof.

<p>This exactly destroys the argument that secrecy helps government 
protect its citizens i.e NSA mass surveillance. I fear the fight for 
privacy has already been lost. We are moving into a dangerous new era in
 American history. These technologies haven't even begun to be used at 
their full potential. They will be when you begin to see serious 
dissidents rise up against the US government.</p>

<p>This is our government, through their various enforcement arms, 
spying on its own citizens.  The extent to which that government and its
 agencies will go to prevent those citizens from even learning the 
capabilities of these spying devices, much less who, when, and why 
they're used should say everything that needs to be said about the 
current state of the republic.</p><p>When the executive branch and its 
bureaucracy bypasses the legislative branch and outright lies to and 
deceives the judiciary...it's called the beginning of a dictatorship.  
I'll admit, that does sound bombastic but we have a sitting president 
who usurps power from the legislative branch every day and brags about 
his pen and phone threatening to do more of it.</p><p>This is how you get totalitarian rule.  The Stasi, Gestapo, NKVD and Cheka before them would have done exactly the same thing.</p>

<p>America has already been lost. I'm convinced of that more and more. 
If we could compare snapshots of America through the decades I think 
we'd all be alarmed at how totalitarian the government has become. The 
only thing holding the absurd facade of "freedom" together is the 
massive entitlement programs keeping the populating fat and docile.</p>

<p>You don't know what you're talking about.  Plenty of spying was going
 on in the 60's. And as computerization and satellite technology 
advanced in the 70s and 80s, it got more high tech.  I can compare those
 snapshots, and while privacy is taking a beating, in many ways the 
government is less totalitarian than it was in the 50s.  You are just 
taking the opportunity to whine about your ignorant fantasies of welfare
 recipients.</p>

<p>The trouble with your incorrect comparison was that activities in the
 60's, 70's and 80's was conducted against specific target individuals 
and groups.  People like anarchists, German nationals/sympathizers 
during the wars, Bolsheviks/communists, and so on.  There was never a 
program that, for instance, collected the date, time, location, and 
recipient of phone calls in the US.  There is such a program now.</p><p>The
 difference is that, back then, those agencies didn't have technology 
they could avail themselves to to do this kind of wide sweeping net 
approach to domestic spying.</p><p>No, things ARE much worse now than 
ever before.  It's not an ignorant fantasy.  ALL of us, regardless of 
our activities, are now the subject of domestic intelligence gathering. 
 Not just our leaders' definition of malcontents/undesirables.  That is 
what makes today worse.</p>

<p>I have no idea what you think you're taking exception to but yes, 
those police state organs would indeed have done the exact same things 
(and I suppose I should have added for the petulant, argumentative, 
ignoramus' in the audience) HAD THEY HAD THE TECHNOLOGY (I can't believe
 I had to actually explain the reference).</p><p>Those ministries were 
all actively conducting surveillance of their own citizens to the 
greatest extent they could within the capabilities of the technology of 
the day.  Opening mail, tapping telephone lines, encouraging citizens to
 report on each other.  So yes, had they had something like cell phones,
 the internet, email and the like, they would indeed have been all over 
it like the NSA, FBI and local law enforcement are.</p><p>So, no, I did 
not "over-subscribe" to anything (I'm sorry you wasted your cute little 
chart there).  Perhaps next time you feel the urge to suggest someone is
 incorrect you might take a pause in your bustling out of charts and 
actually point out what you perceive to be their logical shortcoming and
 suggest why you feel it's in error.  Mind you, that would require that 
you should be possessed of at least a hint of an atom of a clue...so 
that might could be a substantial obstacle.</p>

<p>He said they were used under judicial review. Did anyone ask if they 
ran it by a teenager? Teenagers can be very judgmental. Perhaps they 
asked my grandmother: she judges everyone and everything. We had a 
President defend himself by shading the definition of is. The next one 
removed any doubt we are living in a surveillance state. The current one
 has kept us skipping down that road. By any practical measure we live 
in the most wonderful time ever, but our society has a giant blind spot 
to this type of crap, public or private.</p>

<p>Any evidence that there were actually cases dismissed to prevent 
disclosure of the collection technique? That would be something the 
general public would actually care about</p><p>The text requires court 
orders which might disclose info about the Stingray to be sent to the 
FBI so they have time to "intervene", but claiming they would actively 
kill the case rather than just obfuscate their asses off is a pretty big
 leap.</p>

<p>I presume that you're being sarcastic ... but for those who take you seriously:<br>You
 have everything to hide.  Every American commits an average of 3 
felonies each day.  Yes, you too.  With the massive surveillance we have
 today, all of those felonies are being recorded.  All it takes is for 
someone with access to those records to get pissed off with you and 
you're toast.  Welcome to federal prison.<br>Tell me, how is this 
different from most dictatorships today?  Most citizens of these 
countries are quite safe.  Crime is quite low.  All the regular citizen 
has to worry about is whether or not one of the "police" takes an 
interest in him/her.  If that happens, the citizen is toast.  Sound 
familiar?</p>

<p>I was referring to and relying on the book, "3 Felonies A Day," <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Three-Felonies-Day-Target-Innocent/dp/1594035229" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Three-Fe...</a>.
  Some Googling shows that the book has received some criticism for 
overstating the frequency, as you suggest.  Nevertheless, the basic 
premise of the book, that the Federal Code is so bloated that the common
 citizen regularly commits felonies without knowing it, isn't generally 
disputed.  See also <a href="https://twitter.com/CrimeADay" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/CrimeADay</a>.</p>

<p>We had a bomb threat at one of our local middle schools right next to
 my house, I noticed about 12~16 minutes later all cellphone service in 
the area was being actively denied and stayed that way for a few hours 
afterwards before suddenly coming back to my usual 4 bar service.</p><p>The
 strange part was that wi-fi service through my houses router was also 
affected, so i requested a skiptrace on a command prompt to google then 
checked it again when service came back, and it had an additional step 
that took 120ms that wasn't there a few hours later despite running it a
 few times more.</p><p>I can only think that the Oklahoma sheriffs department planted one of these in my neighborhood for awhile.</p>

<p>This sounds like a signal jammer to me, not a stingray. Stingrays are
 designed to allow data to pass to a valid tower after "checking in" 
with the stingray, so they don't usually disrupt service for very long 
or very consistently.</p>

<p>So, cell signal and wifi are two different data comm sources.  I've 
not heard that this Stingray thing has anything to do with landline 
internet connections.</p><p>More likely: the local sheriff's department 
has the authority to ask the local information carriers (cell carriers, 
ISPs) to curtail their services in the event of a local emergency or to 
impose a recording step somewhere in the delivery of either.</p>
