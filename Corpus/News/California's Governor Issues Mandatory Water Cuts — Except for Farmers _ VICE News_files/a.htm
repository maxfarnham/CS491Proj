<p>Brown is such a shyster. Farmers don't have any water to begin with 
because of an obscure "protected" minnow that is only there because of 
the CA aqueducts to begin with.  Meanwhile in Arizona, there are no 
water restrictions of any kind...</p><p>Does anybody realize that 
Southern California and the Central Valley were arid before they were 
populated en mass? Like anything else in the environment, if the 
decision is made to play with it, something else had to give.  In the 
case of farming, CA aqueducts created micro-environmental conditions for
 minnows in areas they had not previously lived. Now that they 
supposedly live in these areas, farmers can't use the land for which the
 water was diverted in the first place.  Absolutely absurd.</p>

<p>Farmers are paying millions of dollars to keep their crops alive and 
in many cases taking out orchards in their prime. Farmers aren't 
included in the 25% mandatory decrease because they've been cut back 
75-100% already. I'm all for SGMA, but the misleading title and lack of 
acknowledgement to the farmers view is insufficient.</p><p>Who are you, Kai?</p>

<p>20% of water in California is used to grow alfalfa to feed the horses
 of rich Californians. The people aren't the problem, the total lack or 
regulation is. The price of public water is also way too low and 
encourages waste. The big agro farmers are out drilling and out pumping 
the little farms and threatening to collapse the entire aquifer. Time 
for some tough regulations and increase the water prices.</p>

<p>first You need to understand what caused the problem in the place it 
has nothing to the drought. most the water the farmers in central valley
 used came from the Sacramento Delta and the politicians shut the dam to
 protect the Delta smelt. they do not have the right either to the water
 in the aqua duct. iy was not until recently had to pay for water 
because most farmers here they pump the water from underground wells.   
they fill all the reservoir over here to raise the underground water 
table. so it's not public water. But your right the problems not the 
people but rather weak politicians like Jerry brown who stratil the 
fence wasting billions of dollars to divert the canal to the south to 
protect a two inch fish.  </p>
