<p>“The Ancient Greeks used it, the Romans used it, Scandanavian folk 
tales, Japanese folk tales, European folk tales. We’ve used them all 
along. Why have we suddenly got rather snobbish and sneer-y about it in 
just the last few years?”</p><p>Not just so recent: as far back as the 
1960s, notable literary figures such as Germaine Greer and Edmund Wilson
 decried the success of Tolkien and Lord of the Rings. Doesn't make it 
right, but there appears to be a long, ignoble history of bashing the 
fantasy genre (though perhaps by "the last few years", Ishiguro is 
referring to the last century… a short time, relatively speaking).</p>

<p>Earlier in our history, people regularly believed that such 
fantastical creatures actually existed.  Now, with our far better tool 
for explaining our existence, science, we know they not only don't exist
 but they can't exist.  This is a good thing, I think.  I don't worry or
 complain that others enjoy reading such stories for entertainment, 
however they're certainly not of any interest to me.</p><p>I do resent 
people who continue to lie to their children with stories of Santa 
Clause, Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, &amp; etc.  Adults wanting to read 
stories about vampires and monsters is one thing, but conning children 
with that garbage is cruel and abusive.  Children deserve the truth.</p>

<p>While mythical creatures have been exaggerated many of them are quite
 real. Santa Clause was the Catholic Saint Nicholas circa 270 AD. The 
Easter Bunny originally represented a pagan fertility ritual. Both 
eventually became a blend of Wicca, Druid and Christian beliefs. 
Unicorns are male goats and rams whose horns were malformed twisting 
around one another to form a single horn. Kimodo Dragons were discovered
 at a time when the average man was 5'6" tall so the Kimodo would have 
looked immense, In the cold air the breath of the Kimodo would have 
looked like smoke. Giants were most likely people suffering from 
hyperplesia of the pituitary gland..</p>

<p>I think it a little sad you see things that way, and you kind of miss
 the whole point about folktales. For one, I loved the tradition of 
Santa Claus (and the tooth fairy to some degree) - I don't feel I was 
lied to as a child. As an adult I can see how, in a sense, these things 
actually exist - as a cultural tradition and in the spirit of the 
parents who dress up and go to the trouble to create this magical 
experience for their children.</p><p>Also, as someone who's probably 
grown up on Disney and sanitised fairy tales, are you aware of the 
original versions? There are many, many variations of the familiar 
stories from all over the world, but they all feature really quite 
brutal aspects. They were designed to teach and scare and prepare kids 
for a hostile world. There was nothing about lying to them there, quite 
the opposite (although, in those days, a lot less was hidden from 
children - sex and violence were all around them). In one Eastern 
European version of Snow White, the story is almost the same as the one 
we know so well, but at the end Snow White and the Prince invite the 
wicked Queen to their wedding, where they make her put on red hot iron 
shoes and dance for them.</p><p>Angela Carter worked to reintroduce the 
blood and gore in her extraordinary work, The Bloody Chamber, which is 
one of the greatest achievements of contemporary fiction. Have a read of
 this and look up original folk tales from Europe or, if you want to 
read something *really* crazy - check out some of the original Inuit 
folktales... <a href="http://www.inuitmyths.com/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.inuitmyths.com/inde...</a></p>

<p>I agree with James,W. Fairytales and folktales maintained by our 
parents are there to create a magical world for their children and to 
create an imagination that every child should posses. As a young child I
 can remember keeping myself busy for hours simply because I got lost in
 my own imagination and the marvellous 'adventures' I conjured up. As 
mentioned , most of the folktale do have some significant meaning and I 
find it important to tell your children about these meanings, how else 
will they learn some basic knowledge of how mankind's actions and 
emotions works ?<br>In all honesty, I myself am not a fan of  the 
fantasy genre, however, when an author can transform your world into 
another and let you experience what the characters experience , it is a 
truly great book and that is the true beauty behind literature. Of 
course the brilliant romance novels written by authors such as Jane 
Austen and Emily Bronte do not transform your world but they give 
insight to human emotions and the puzzling things we do as curious and 
naïve creatures.<br>All in all, the different genres of literature are 
not only there for our entertainment but also to show us that there are 
different worlds, different people and to encourage humankind to explore
 their imagination ... without it , what would man be ?<br>15084192</p>

<p>Hear hear!</p><p>Personally, I don't know why people get so hung up 
on genres anyway. Ok, people like what they like and genres serve a 
practical purpose as "signposts" to something you're likely to like, or 
to avoid. But genre mixing has been an interesting and welcome 
development in literature in recent times - one of the reasons Doris 
Lessing's The Fifth Child is studied at University. On the whole I think
 there's something more going on with genre clinginess - it's about 
identity. Some people like to make a statement about themselves by 
saying they "only read literary fiction" or "only watch French cinema". 
Which is a shame I think, as there is so much wealth across all art. 
Some people wouldn't be caught dead reading "sci-fi", but that isn't 
just to judge a book by its cover, it's to dismiss an entire genre! A 
whole universe of imagination. You'd miss Iain M Banks' stunning Culture
 novels for example. And nothing I've seen in film or the written word 
yet comes close to the vast scope and imagination of these works.</p><p>Equally,
 I find it ridiculous that people would critisise Ishiguro for including
 ogres in his latest book. It's pretentious snobbery dressed up as 
literary criticism and it's rather sad and so very obvious in my view. I
 for one can't wait to read The Buried Giant and I bet it has the same, 
incredible subtle and very wise observations and social commentary 
Ishiguro brings to his work oh so well.</p>

<p>No, I don't miss the point of folktales.  Many still have a draw for 
me.  At base, I'm saying, it's the 21st Century.  We've better things to
 work with now.  Teaching children stories about wicked witches living 
in gingerbread houses luring unsuspecting children into forests to be 
eaten is hardly constructive in any meaningful way today.  That sort of 
thing may have had a purpose in earlier days, but not now.</p>

<p>I really don't think it's a case of one or the other, or indeed 
"fantasy vs science" or "past vs future". Firstly, if you're familiar 
with The Hero with a Thousand Faces or The Writer's Journey, you'd 
realise that the same basic plot underpins pretty much every story 
you've ever known, from the most ancient oral traditions, to Greek 
Myths, to Hollywood. Or the Seven Basic Plots, where "overcoming the 
monster" is no different in Rocky IV as it is in Beowulf. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T...</a></p><p>That's
 a whole subject in itself, but on a different tack, did you know that 
scientific knowledge appears to have been recorded/encoded in ancient 
myths and legends? Santillana and Dechend's extraordinary work Hamlet's 
Mill, explores how astronomical knowledge reoccurs in myths from around 
the world. For example, the "encoding" of precessional numbers required 
to calculate the precession of the equinoxes is very prevalent in Norse 
legends. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet%27s_Mill" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H...</a></p><p>We
 might have libraries and textbooks and the internet now, but it seems 
stories were one way we handed knowledge down over the ages. What 
scientific knowledge - or wisdom - might still be there that we could 
benefit from today? That in itself would be an interesting study, 
notwithstanding the universal and timeless aspects of human psychology -
 the archetypes of the mind - that make The Hero's Journey so compelling
 to us, story after story, generation after generation.</p>

<p>Stories like hansel and gretel can help paint a story on how life was
 like back in the day. Perhaps not through a  gingerbread house but in 
other ways like how things were cooked, or how there used to be big 
fields everywhere etc... There is a need to keep interest in the past, 
you never know when it'll become useful in life.</p>

<p>Well, if you do start to fear the boogeyman, then once you overcome 
that fear you'll be stronger. If you can't overcome it, you have a weak 
mind and need more training. As the old saying goes, what doesn't kill 
you makes you stronger. Plus as a kid you only see a few horrors. 1. 
Your parents when mad 2. school bullies 3. veggies. The rest of the 
world is a peaceful place as a kid. At any rate, they have morals in 
those stories, if you can't see them then I've got bad news for you...</p>

<p>"And it’s the Christian nations that rampaged around the globe, 
creating these empires, all over the world, and it’s an interesting 
thought as to whether that would have been quite so easy had they not 
had this god who would forgive them anything."</p><p>I would merely 
point to the other nations preceding the Christian ones, which rampaged 
all over the world regardless of the fact that they had gods which 
forgave nothing.  In fact, one might point to the unforgiving gods as a 
force which drove human beings to commit atrocities a-plenty... such as 
with, for example, the Aztec Empire.</p><p>Preceding Christianity, there
 was no concept of chivalric honor.  There were few examples where a 
vanquished army wasn't simply slaughtered en masse or driven into 
slavery.  Genocide was a common way of dealing with different cultures.</p><p>But this same "god who would forgive them anything" also sat in judgment after they died.</p><p>And
 so, there were those moments when the actual teachings came to mind, 
and a leader of nations or men might stop --- just for that one day, if 
nothing else --- and question whether or not his immortal soul was, 
indeed, truly secure for eternity.</p>

<p>All genre fiction is fantasy. The genre we call Fantasy is about 
magic and beings that do not exist in this world; Science fiction is 
about technologies and beings that do not exist in this time and place; 
Romance is about idealized relationships that don't really exist; 
Westerns are about an idealized version of history that never existed as
 it is portrayed, that also goes for most historical fiction and wartime
 stories; Mysteries turn gruesome murders into genteel puzzles.</p><p>Successful literary fiction usually has some element of genre fiction within it.</p><p>But
 Fantasy, at least, is straightforward about itself, and doesn't pretend
 to be "real" in the sense of the setting; as a result it is often free 
to be more real about the hearts of the characters.</p><p>Tolkien, who 
pretty much created Fantasy as we know it, and who set the bar so high 
that others have yet to get over it, said in his famous essay about 
fantasy and fairy tales: "That the images of things not in the primary 
world at all (if that indeed is possible), is a virtue not a vice. 
Fantasy (in this sense) is, I think, not a lower but a higher form of 
Art, indeed the most nearly pure form, and so, when achieved, the most 
potent."</p><p>To the complaint that Fantasy is escapism: "I have 
claimed that Escape is one of the main functions of fairy-stories, and 
since I do not disapprove of them, it is plain that I do not accept the 
tone of scorn or pity with which 'Escape' is now so often used. Why 
should a man be scorned if, finding himself in prison, he tries to get 
out and go home? Or if he cannot do so, he thinks and talks about other 
topics than jailers and prison-walls?"<br>To any who truly enjoy the Fantasy genre, I highly recommend that essay, "On Fairy-Stories".</p><p>And finally, here is his pithy response to many of his critics, from one of his letters:<br>“Some
 who have read the book, or at any rate have reviewed it, have found it 
boring, absurd, or contemptible, and I have no cause to complain, since I
 have similar opinions of their works, or of the kinds of writing that 
they evidently prefer.”<br>To be honest, I think "gritty realism" is 
highly unrealistic as well. Most lives, most real-life stories (as in 
those which happen to actual people) are a mixture of good things and 
bad, and many people live contented lives even through the hard times. 
That is not Fantasy.</p>

<p>Seriously, wasn't 50 shades of grey a softcore fantasy fic about 
twilight characters originally? Why would someone pay $15 for a fantasy 
experience that is less than anything you find on say redtube? lol I 
find it amusing when people say 50 shades is so hardcore. lmao... 
lightweights living in vanilla mode.</p>

<p>"And it’s the Christian nations that rampaged around the globe, 
creating these empires, all over the world, and it’s an interesting 
thought as to whether that would have been quite so easy had they not 
had this god who would forgive them anything.”</p><p> It's a wonder how 
the Romans, the Ancient Greeks, the Assyrians, the Persians the Huns, 
the Egyptians, were able to Empire build and rule their known worlds 
under less merciful deities.  Maybe Roman wouldn't have fallen under a 
forgiving God.  No, wait. Christian Rome did fall.  Nevertheless, it 
must be the concept of a loving merciful God that is behind the evils of
 empire building.  It just makes sense.</p>

<p>Wait, isn't the usual tired argument that the faithful are only good 
out of fear of damnation?  Since you are unquestionably correct, I guess
 the faithful are good because it is the right thing.  Imagine that.

<p>It may be that readers just want a more defined boundary between 
Science Fiction and Fantasy Fiction.  Science Fiction should incorporate
 1 or more components of "technology" whereas Fantasy Fiction usually 
(but not always) does not.  Over time it sets expectations about what 
you are consuming -- some people want only a diet of dragons and magic, 
and some people want only robots, aliens and futuristic weapons (yes, 
I'm generalizing here).  Those expectations are carried into the brick 
and mortal book stores as well as online - they don't like stores mixing
 SciFi and Fantasy on the same bookshelf let alone same section.  While 
others don't seem to see a problem with it.</p><p>I like both genres but
 my preference is SciFi.  So when a favourite author switches-up or 
blends genres, it can be a disappointment (or a welcome surprise) 
depending on your expectations.</p>

<p>I always find people who dismiss fantasy fiction amusing. Fairy tales
 are and always have been the most read/told genre around the world for

<p>This prejudice is clear in cinema as well as literature. A relative 
used to be an executive at a major studio. His mantra was "a movie 
doesn't need special effects to be good."  This is an obviously true 
statement. However, this isn't the statement he means. The actual 
meaning of is statement is, in fact, the corollary: "if it has special 
effects, it isn't a good movie". He "knows" that movies with special 
effects are no good, so he doesn't watch them. Period.</p><p>The prejudice against fanatasy or speculative fiction won't end anytime soon. </p>

<p>In my opinion, allowing children to read fictional books opens the 
young mind to thinking in a different ways. Safe-guarding your child and
 only exposing them to non-fiction books makes them think in black and 
white, it makes a single minded thinker with no creativity and no 
imagination. Escaping into a world of adventure and excitement provides 
an escape from the real world which is sometimes all a child needs.</p><p>15038352</p>

<p>If he produces a beautifully-written fantasy tale, in league with 
Lord of the Rings, then of course it will be read ... and probably made 
into movies and he'll get rich.<br>But personally, even though I am a 
big "hard sci-fi" fan, I just am not interested in the "magic" or 
"fantasy" section of that aisle of the bookstore.<br>I'm interested in 
sci-fi that relates to future technologies or development that *might* 
be possible, mainly because as a reader, I can feel more connected to 
the story (this is something that *could* happen and what if it actually
 did?)<br>Magic, on the other hand, is ..... well, "not real" ... the 
characters in the story might be interesting and if the story characters
 are well developed then you might read it for that reason.<br>But to be
 honest there are a heck of a lot of "King Arthur - knights slaying 
dragons magical wizards" --- fantasy books out there. Maybe if I were 10
 years old the flight of fantasy might be fun ... but at this stage, I 
prefer the sci-fi.<br>My sadness is that there seem to be far fewer 
sci-fi books on the shelves ... there are a heck of a lot more in the 
fantasy section.<br>Why is there so little great sci-fi out there?</p>

<p>Parents have a right to raise their children as they please, but 
children have a right to experience a world outside their own which 
gives wings to their imagination. We as adults tend to be so caught up

<p>Personally, having read some of the book and then stopped, Ishiguro 
himself doesn't seem to be taking the genre very seriously.  Maybe it's 
just that the main characters are 
old/senile/under-some-vaugueness-spell, but the result is a boring, 
ill-defined world and characters, and no real interest in where they are
 going or why.  Like many high-art dabblers in the fantastic, he seems 
more interested in thinking about fantasy as a genre and literary 
phenomenon than in constructing vivid and interesting worlds or even 
vivid and interesting characters.  Maybe the book gets better, but so 
far it feels like the author is about a million miles from his creation,
 himself under some spell of vagueness.</p>

<p>Fair enough. The main difference between Science Fiction and Fantasy 
is that Science Fiction tries to explain how it works (while often being

 currently possible and may never be possible.</p>
