<p>No, I am complaining about a destructive memetic movement beginning 
to grow, and how it would be wise to reconize it an nip it in the bud 
before it gets started., Do you always take things at face value? Do you
 think feminists will be satisfied after those initial demands? Are 
North American feminists satisfied now? No. Movements like this 
continually seek an enemy and covet their victim status. Feminism will 
never end. They will never be satisfied. It isn't about feminism, it's 
simply a vehicle for political power. The feminists are just the shock 
troops.</p>

<p>So you're arguing against women having political power and using that
 power to achieve policy goals that are favorable to them? I don't know 
of anything "North American feminists" are asking for that is outrageous
 to a degree that I feel they Chinese women should be in jail over 
public toilets to "nip it in the bud".  Obviously abortion on demand is 
already prevalent in China. Sounds like you've got lady problems, bub.</p>

<p>I am arguing nothing of the sort. Women in China have considerable 
political and social power, in Asian societies women are responsible for
 the majority of the family decisions and all the household money.</p><p>Perhaps
 you have not been paying attention to North American feminists, but 
they have long since passed the point of absurdity. You remind me of a 
puritanical Christian Missionary who wants nothing more than to export 
your values all over the face of the Earth.</p><p>I have lived in Asia 
for ten years. They have an ancient society that works quite well. Yes 
there are roles for men and women, but you have no right to push your 
values and morality on them. I suggest you stop being so judgmental, you
 do not know the entire story behind why these women are in jail and, of
 course, a Western article is going to paint the feminists in the most 
favorable light possible. VICE news became "progressive politics for 
Hipsters" a long time ago.</p><p>And, of course, you have to end your 
comment with a bit of snark and a personal attack, suggesting that if I 
do not agree with you then I must have problems with women. Please stick
 to debating the point rather than embarrass yourself with rubbish like 
this.</p><p>I suggest you refer to my comment below, the challenge to achieve equality that has not yet been answered.</p>

<p>"export your values all over the face of the Earth....you have no 
right to push your values and morality on them"  This is about Chinese 
women in China protesting violence against women, so that makes no 
sense. I'm doing nothing but having an opinion. So why don't you tell us
 the "entire story" since you apparently know it to a degree you are 
celebrating the jailing of these women? What awful things did they do to
 warrant their detention?</p>

<p>What we have here is a religious puritan. Did I utter heresy? The 
West is being destroyed by feminism and progressive policies. Equality 
is a false God. Men and women are not the same, and therefore can not be
 treated the same lest they lie in the Procrustean Bed.</p><p>The 
definition of a troll is not somebody who merely has a contrary opinion.
 You employ the typical liberal argument, leaping to conclusions that I 
want to keep women enslaved followed by a pathetic attempt at shaming.</p>

<p>Feminism has destroyed nothing. The political and environmental 
landscape as it exists was formed by whom? All of the worlds major 
conflict was created under a patriarchal society. Clearly men are not 
capable of solving these issues alone. Those five women are merely 
bringing attention to the fact that women in their society are treated 
as second class citizens and shining a light on the abuses that many 
women face because of their gender. They do so despite the fact that 
doing so makes them a bigger target to those same abuses.  Why do you 
take offense to that? I cant see any reason to unless you are a 
proponent of sexism or spousal abuse.</p>

<p>Feminism destroys competition, because feminist are handout warriors 
with extreme double standards, they want more, more and more yet they 
contribute nothing, all of the world is created by men, yet when they 
are allowed more entitlements nothing works, everything cease into an 
unending whining, anger at their own failings and deep seated 
insecurities. I simply loath feminism because it's never about gender 
equality in the first place, it's about gender entitlement.</p>

<p>Feminism by definition promotes equal treatment of women and thereby 
creates competition by basically doubling the number of people competing
 for a given position. As far as their contributions go, think back to 
WW2 and I'm sure that you can recall that it was women who stepped up in
 the factories and produced the guns, tanks, planes and ships used to 
win the war. the feminist movement gained serious momentum  from that 
when women realized that they were capable of something more than 
housework and child rearing.<br>Going back further, It was women like Lucy Stone who were amongst the first to speak out against slavery.<br>Harriet Tubman played a key role in the running of the underground railroad.<br>So to say that women contribute nothing is a false statement. They played a major role in the anti slavery movement.</p><p>As far as feminism being a movement of entitlement, I will agree in so far as it promotes entitlement to equal treatment.</p>

<p>The definition of Feminism is rarely followed and because men and 
women aren't equal, equality is impossible to achieve. Let me give you a
 simple example:</p><p>I own a business. I have two employees, a man and
 a woman. The man can carry two bricks an hour, the woman can carry one.
 How would you go about achieving equality in this situation?</p><p>If 
we strive for equality the only thing we can do is destroy. The tall

<p>This is obviously not a specific example, but an allegory intended to
 teach you that it is impossible to make unequal things equal. See also 
the Procrustean Bed and the Tall Poppy Syndrome. The only way to enforce
 equality is to make the man work slower. Please try and extrapolate the
 meaning of this and imagine applying it to all of society. We have had 
fifty years of this nonsense, endless mewling discussions have nearly 
ground our civilization to a halt. What's most frustrating is that we 
have all these lessons from Ancient Greece which teach us the futility 
of this nonsense, but our heritage as Europeans is no longer taught to 
us.</p><p>China is going into space. We're worried about who feels comfortable in what bathroom. It's nonsense.</p>

<p>I believe that there is a bit of a perversion going on here. The 
expression equal work for equal pay is one that in no way attempts to 
skew progress or make an attempt to receive equal pay for less work. 
Additionally the feminists in question were protesting, among other 
things, the way that the courts treat female victims of domestic abuse. 
They did this in an attempt to shed light on a very serious issue. Any 
sane person wouldn't have an issue with this.</p><p> Not all feminists 
actions are as outlandish as what you propose. In fact, I believe that 
most will agree with a portion of what you say regarding ability  but it
 doesn't change the fact that if a woman is capable of performing a set 
task at a level equal to or greater than her male counterparts, she 
should be entitled to the same opportunities for advancement and the 
same compensation. <br>If this concept goes against the grain to your 
sense of male privilege, perhaps its time that you do a self inventory 
and address what issues you have and embrace reality.</p>
