<p>A few years ago they found what appeared to be tank tracks in the mud
 on the sea floor is the Fjords of Norway, whilst no one has proven 
their source it's often thought that they were some form of Russian 
vehicle. Trust, the concept of underwater 'tanks' is well and truly out 
there.</p>

<p>Hmmm, what about peaceful applications? An arms race itself is no 
good, but technology that puts humanity undersea today is technology 
that sustains humanity undersea tomorrow. A real Atlantis. With climate 
change threatening to drown our coasts and shrink our habitable landmass
 while the population of the world only grows, this could be the answer 
to many problems. Besides, who wouldn't want to live underwater? Right?</p>

<p>This is a very good point. Consider this: <a href="https://news.vice.com/article/get-ready-for-an-explosion-of-mining-on-the-ocean-floor" rel="nofollow">https://news.vice.com/article/...</a></p><p>The
 terrain-involved stuff in general amounts to a specific type of civil 
engineering and the military application may be a sort of conceptual and
 technological foot in the door, that can lead to more direct use and 
application. For the immediate future, this is all kind of hard to do on
 a cost basis, but still an interesting thing to consider.</p>

<p>Meh, as mentioned, deep sea ROVs have been around a long time. The 
way undersea fiber is laid is via what is essentially a robotic tank 
with arms and no guns that rolls on the seabed blasting a narrow trench 
in the sand to lay the fiber. The one Odyssey Marine uses was taken 
directly from service and refitted for submarine artifact salvage with 
the addition of various little suckers and a venturi dredge.</p>

<p>Do you have any sort of source on these? Last time I had to work with
 guys who did the sea cable laying was almost a decade ago, and back 
then the cable laying ship was basically a high grade GPS-guided ship 
with powerful lateral engines, and cable laying was something of a mix 
of science and art. Cable had to be laid precicely according to 
premapped route with almost no deviation, there was entire science 
behind the angle at which it was laid and so on.</p><p>But there was no 
submercible. It was all done on the surface, which is what made it so 
damn difficult. Same thing for cable repairs - you had to use special 
hooking to grab onto the cable, lift it aboard the ship, fix the cabling
 and then lay it back down. Did something change in last decade?</p>

<p>Interesting. So instead of doing the undersea topography and then 
accurate laying of the cable, they basically dredge a path and fill it 
after the cable is in.</p><p>That would certainly reduce anchor damage 
massively and make cables much cheaper because you won't need to armour 
them up in low depth areas.</p><p>Makes me wonder what happened to specialized ships that were used to lay cables down the old way.</p>

<p>Honestly, the current state of mass media could use some "trolling". A

<p>That's the thing. Those are very expensive specialized ships. I 
recall them having stability requirements of moving no more than three 
meters off plotted course even in storms, which was achieved by having 
very powerful lateral motors directly controlled by high grade GPS 
assisted navigation computers.</p><p>You don't just write that kind of a vessel down and ram it on shore to be stripped for materials it's made of.</p>

<p>Nope. But this is a bit of a different issue. It's one thing to have 
standard modern navigation kit. I'm somewhat familiar with those. 
Admittedly not intimately any more, but I still retain friends who are 
professional seamen.</p><p>These ships however had automated lateral 
stabilization that allowed them to basically remain on exact course down
 to about three metres in an oceanic storm. That while not being 
anywhere near the scale of Emma Maersk, so they couldn't use inertia in 
the same way she does to achieve it - they had to have very powerful 
lateral thrusters at multiple points along the hull which were fully 
automated to navigational computer which in turn used high grade GPS to 
ensure ship stayed on course.</p><p>This isn't your average medium sized
 container ship or cruise ship. While automation has gone leaps and 
bounds since then, this kind of maneuvreability and stability is a very 
rare thing to have in a ship.</p>

<p>things are way too crowded now. You dont have miles to turn a 
freighter. The harbors are all clogged and the locks are worse. In 
addition the overall quality of seamanship is lubberly in most places. 
Just about all modern ships have thrusters just to be able to navigate

<p>My point was probably not well expressed. I mean that specialized 
vessels like those likely have other uses and are simply too valuable to
 just sell for scrap.</p><p>Those things were, back when I know they 
were used, manned by top notch crews as well because keeping a vessel 
like that running required specialist knowledge from most of the crew. 
This is similar to drilling rigs and such, where you get blue collar 
seaman jobs but they are highly paid because they require deep 
specialization and skill.</p><p>Training such crews and building such 
specialized vessels is typically a long term investment, which protects 
both from being fired/scrapped like your average cargo carrier 
crews/ships.</p>
