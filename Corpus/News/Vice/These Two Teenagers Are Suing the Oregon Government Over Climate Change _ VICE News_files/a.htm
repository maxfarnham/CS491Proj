<p>They weren't talking about a specific law, they were talking about 
law in general. Also propaganda for what? Taking climate change

for expanded federal intervention.</p>

<p>you are awfully simple minded, not your fault it has been by design  ...............let me unwrap the propaganda for you .</p><p>Two
 young innocent kids , a standard marketing ploy , everyone likes kids 
acting like adults , its so cute .......that is the hook ,  now these 
innocents are suing a uncooperative state Gov for NOT DOING ENOUGH  to 
stop "Global Warming"..................funny how this administration is 
screaming because Congress wont act and Obama cant do MORE to combat 
"Global Warming"  The flat-earth science society's latest 'settled' 
science  charade</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

<p>"You're confusing law and legislation."<br>You're assuming that I'm 
confusing law and legislation because you've entirely missed the nuance 
of that statement. As said in a previous statement, this has to do with a
 'news' organization publishing a nonsense story about some kids with no
 legal standing embarking to save the world through lawsuits as some 
sort of persuasion for expanded federal intervention. That's not law; 
that's propagandistic pseudo-law.</p><p>"In context, that's the definition of cutting-edge law, yo"      No it's not, yo…see above comment.</p><p>"That's pure opinion, from beginning to end." Congratulations, you know what an opinion is…even when it's true.</p><p>"Nope."  Yep.<br>"Just
 realised that you've taken one partial quote and made a point about it 
in relation to the entire article."  Nope. Granted, it was poorly 
arranged, but the question of law was a refutation that this is 'cutting
 edge law;' and the statement about the dumbness and propagandistic 
value of Vice's work is most directly related to the title, but also to a
 few other things..</p><p>The Government legalized domestic propaganda 
in 2013, the pentagon declared 'climate change' the most dangerous issue
 facing humanity, Biden and Obama have recently visited Vice about its 
expanding ability to reach youth viewers as 'CNN Youth,' Vice has 
increasingly published climate change pieces with large confirmation 
bias, and this particular article is about an issue which even the 
courts admit is not a matter for their ruling. Yet, the article assumes 
the notion that even nonsense waste-of-time litigation (put forth by 
'children') can prove useful to the agenda. That is an insidious and 
propagandistic tactic. <br>…so yeah, you missed a few things.</p>

<p>Stop fear mongering like a neocon!</p><p>Get up to date;<br>We have 
such little smog now that "smog levels" no longer even measure smog; 
they measure conditions that "could" lead to being able to measure any 
smog. That's why "Alerts", "Advisories", "Watches" and "Be Kind to Air 
Days" are only predictions that smog "could be" measured within the next
 36 hours. And if that happens its called a; "Smog Warning" or real 
smog.<br>Now for a decade and a half we have had no real detectable or more accurately; "meaningful" smog levels at all.</p>

<p>Its funny how there is such little regulation for mining and oil

such a small level of accountability until the public find out.</p>
