According to their terrorist Ideologue (al-Qaradawi), Bin Laden came from the Muslim Brotherhood, al-Zawahiri also came from Muslim Brotherhood, al-Badgdadi of ISIS is Muslim Brotherhood, those of 9/11 were Muslim Brotherhood. the terrorism of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt is not different from 9/11 and is not different from terrorism in Libya, Syria or Iraq. the killing of the US Ambassador and staff in Libya is not different from killing people in Egypt.

<p>I agree that Obama sucks but he has nothing to do with this 
journalist getting caught helping a terrorist group.  The current 
Egyptian regime has to fight against a violent islamic gang and the 
Egyptian people have decided they want to survive and fight against the 
social retardation caused by sharia.  This islamic journalist and 
terrorist sympathizer, posing as an American citizen, walked into a 
hornet's nest and now thinks someone should come to his rescue? No way. 
In fact, he's lucky, most of his own kind would have beheaded or shot 
him to death by now.</p>

<p>What?  The current Egyptian regime is a military coup that overthrew a
 democratically elected majority after the overthrow of a dictatorship. 
 I'll grant that the Egyptian military coup was much more pro-western 
than the elected Muslim Brotherhood, that alone might have been a good 
enough reason to look the other way in the beginning.  However, at a 
certain point we need to take a step back, look at the growing 
preponderance of human rights abuses and say enough is enough...</p><p>America
 is putting their short term interests before their long term morality. 
 We're on the wrong side of history in this place, at this time.</p>

<p>Yes, but that would do more harm than good, politically. It could 
harm relations with members of congress who support continue military 
support to Egypt. If he messes up those relationships,  it could harm 
his attempts at other future actions. Politics is one big game of chess,
 every move, even small ones, count.</p>

<p>CAIR in the USA is one of the terrorist organisations which destroyed
 and will destroy the US. Islamists whether Muslim Brotherhood or 
others, all terrorist groups and sprung out of the Muslim Brotherhood. 
Also,  all are terrorists and believe in the same source of terrorism. 
So, Why the US meet with the Muslim Brotherhood? According to their 
terrorist Ideologue (al-Qaradawi), Bin Laden came from the Muslim 
Brotherhood, al-Zawahiri also came from Muslim Brotherhood, al-Badgdadi 
of ISIS is Muslim Brotherhood, those of 9/11 were Muslim Brotherhood. 
the terrorism of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt is not different from 
9/11 and is not different from terrorism in Libya, Syria or Iraq. the 
killing of the US Ambassador and staff in Libya is not different from 
killing people in Egypt. Terrorism is terrorism. If the US is happy to 
keep relation with the Muslim Brotherhood the spiritual parent of 
terrorism, then good luck and the US should not complain if there 
terrorism against the US.  To Obama's administration, do not trust the 
Muslim Brotherhood.</p>

<p>Meredith Hoffman is turning out to be a magnificent propagandist. In 
her touching tract she portrays Soltan and his family as beyond 
reproach. What she fails to mention is the fact that Soltan's father, 
Salah, is a known Muslim Brotherhood member and radical anti-Semite. It 
is all documented. So Meredith, if you want to play journalist, I 
suggest you and Vice begin reporting the facts instead of cheerleading 
for these radicals. Perhaps it's just me though and the "news" isn't 
really what Vice is about. Sad stuff.</p>

<p>I don't believe in political islam, but in a democracy they have 
every right to participate, just as much as evangelist christians have 
the right to participate in secular US politics. Killing, imprisoning 
and torturing activists whose political ideology you don't agree with is
 undemocratic and exposes the hypocrisy of secularists.</p>
