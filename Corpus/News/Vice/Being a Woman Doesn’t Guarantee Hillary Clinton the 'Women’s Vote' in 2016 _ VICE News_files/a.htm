<p>So Liz and VICE want us to  forget that Hillary lost $6 billion, 
raised millions in foreign donations, didn't comply with federal 
transparency policy, deleted public records related to/during an 
investigation, improperly stored classified material on an unsecured 
server, and quit her job before people realized that she operated with 
ZERO oversight and accountability throughout her *entire* tenure as 
Secretary of State because the President never appointed an Inspector 
General,<br>but remember... she's a woman…..</p>

<p>I'm certainly not voting republican.  Truthfully, Donald trump 
wouldn't be a bad pick for the repubs though: he openly looks out for 
his interests, and his interests are not in line with the old guard 
financiers of the far right.  Still wouldn't vote for him though.  I'm 
just saying I don't trust Hillary.  She might be one of the most 
misunderstood wrongfully chastised politicians in the country: she's 
still weak, shallow, ungrounded, not very well spoken and the only 
reason people don't say it more is because they're afraid of being 
called sexist.  Her being a woman has nothing to do with why I think 
she's weak, self important, morally bankrupt and generally just....bad. 
 She's said too many things on the record and off that make me question 
her moral fortitude regarding responsibility, accountability and 
decision making in her political career.  Forget the whitewater BS.  She
 has never once convinced me that she believes what she reads/recites in
 front of a camera, and i'm sorry, that's a chief executives job.  
That's a commander in chief's job.  That's the president's job, and I 
don't believe she will ever to do the job any better than below average 
at best.  #Kerry2016 (I wish)</p>

<p>lol your making me laugh. riiighht most democrates campaign is 
focus.on offering temporary benifits to people who havnt earned anything
 whereas consertives are morr focused towards preserving the economy.</p><p>democracy is only temporary in nature <br>it
 simply cannot exist as a permanent form of government. it can only 
exist until voters discover they can vote themselves largesse from the 
pubic treasury. from that point on the majority always votes for the 
candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury with the
 result that a democracy always collapses over lousy fiscal policy</p><p>Alexander Frasier tytler </p>

<p>You're so blind to reality its shocking. You know what happens when 
you let the wealth gap gets too large? Take a look at the favelas in 
Brazil or the slums in India, they are horrible places to live and if 
you think that America is impervious to that, your very nieve. 
Republican economics benefits the rich and makes the poor more poor. 
Trickle down economics is a farce.</p><p>The only functional way for a 
civilization to work is a fully integrated democracy where everyone is 
represented and treated equally.</p>

<p>no such thing as 'republican' economics. There is economics, and 
non-economics. Both parties get about half the equation right. Clinton 
happened to be the last one to get it right, but it's not because he is a
 democrat, it was in spite of him being a democrat.</p>

<p>and I want to add most Democrats don't have any understanding in 
economics at all. taking minimum wage for an example the higher the

<p>Well the increase of minimum wage will lift millions out of poverty. 
The fact is that you cannot support a family on the current minimum. So 
you raise it, give more people more money and hopefully create a 
stronger middle class which is better than the dwindling middle class of
 today, which create more job to lower unemployment.  Republicans plans 
favour big business and the super rich and they outsource all their jobs
 to china anyways, so its a lose-lose for America</p>

<p>doesn't work that way you cannot stop corporations from millions of 
dollars which by the way is what makes capitalism a great system, we 
live in a country that if we work hard enough we can make Alot of money.
 big corporations will just use that as incentive to find ways to use 
less labor. money doesn't grow on trees, nobody is going to pay their 
employees more than they profit the company so they will hire less using
  people with snd use the trained people they already have with 
experience turning minimum wage jobs into something they're not designed
 for by making it harder for unemployed and unexpierenced folk to get a 
job  also effecting small business who can't already cant afford their 
employees and it's only temporary till inflation makes everything more 
expensive and so many other reasons. it's just bad policy and in the end
 the rich stay rich and everybody ends up paying for it somehow</p><p>LIBERAL POLICY = BAD ECONOMICS!</p>

<p>Well I just used that as an example of how this comment was 
ridiculous.  I don't believe that Hillary is severing her interests.  
But even if you are absolutely sure that Hillary is a monster, ask 
yourself; repealing obamacare, renegging on both the China environment 
pact and Iran nuclear deal, as well as disastrous and self serving 
economic plans is all that really a better alternative to voting for 
Hillary?</p>

<p>My god, stupidity of your magnitude should be reason for mandatory 
sterilization laws. ACA aka Obamacare? Its hurt more people that its 
helped. A pyramid scheme since its inception that preyed on everyone, 
especially the younger Americans. China environmental pact? do you have a
 clue what it states? Basically the Chinese don't do $h!t till 2025, 
even then the "carbon cutbacks" are minimal. Barry touted it like a 
great environmental victory to the idi0ts, like you, who ate it up. 
Nuclear deal? Really? What deal? Oh! the one where we are saying the 
Iranians  promised to "x" and they say no, we are lying? That agreement?
 Where both sides are saying the other side agreed to something and each
 say no we didn't?</p><p>Stop wasting precious O2.</p>

<p>China to cap at 2025 and start coming down after that. Considering 
the alternative Republican plan of doing absolutely nothing I will take 
everything that is in the right direction. The Iran framework is a 
fantastic starting point and for those 57 senators to do what they did 
is disgraceful. The GOP doesnt deserve a single vote in 2016. They have 
been and will continue to be a detriment to America.</p>

<p>Not a liberal here, but ...."Objectively" it seems Conservatives 
manipulate religious and moral "emotions" to the nth degree. They can't 
get the black or youth vote, so they get the religious and moral 
conservative vote. Nothing wrong with that, but its still manipulation 
for votes. I bet very few of the politicians really care about  half the
 moral issues (on either side) they tout.</p>

<p>Aha, so not ALL liberals, just Debbie wasserman? And who cares about 
her? Is she the spokesperson for all of liberalism? Seriously, Florida? 
Nobody cares about your murderous doped up state.  If you'd care to 
ACTUALLY SITE EXAMPLES of systemic liberal 'exploitation of minorities 
women and youth', we are all ears.  It might help your case if you 
rephrase your assertion to something more....idunno...true, like maybe 
'It makes me sick when politicians like Debbie wasserman (an 
insignificant speck of dust in Florida's 23rd district) exploits 
bleeding hearts' and then maybe sitean example.  But seriously, we know 
what you're doing.  You're trying to polarize the idiots and the ill 
informed.  If I were you i'd get introspective andreally think hard 
about your worldview, because nobody gives a ish about your opinions 
except yourself.  That's what opinions are: your view.  Liberalism is no
 more of 'an opinion' than conservatism.</p>

<p>Wasserman-Schwartz offers an archetypal example of liberals' constant
