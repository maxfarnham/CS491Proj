<p>The Koch Brothers have spent over $80 million on false and misleading
 information regarding climate change in addition to the $889 Million 
they've donated to the Republican Party. It looks like they've expended 
at least $1,000 on this column alone. Anyone notice ANY scientific 
validation of the absurd comments of the deniers? They're entire list of
 comments boils down to 'all your evidence is wrong but I don't have any
 legitimate of my own'. I prefer to believe people are intelligent 
enough to see through the nonsense these trolls are posting. <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/campaigns/global-warming-and-energy/polluterwatch/koch-industries/" rel="nofollow">http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/...</a></p>

<p>You guys on the left make yourself look sillier when you try and demean the Kochs.<br>These
 guys are libertarian philanthropist. They throw money at liberal and 
conservative causes.  Soros, however, does not have a single tie to 
anything remotely conservative and Buffet too. How do they get a pass? 
Oh, because they support extreme left ideology and policy. Your Evil 
Koch Billionaire scare is nothing more than a battle cry unto your own, 
whether purposely or not, un educated masses.  Kinda like Harry Reid. 
Its his favorite trigger word.</p>

<p>Hoo Me said "The climate has always changed. It will continue to change. No one denies that."</p><p>Yes,
 and species die and will continue to die. No one denies that. We're 
trying to prevent mankind from being on that list, or at least being 
severely affected by it. The biggest extinction in the history of this 
planet was caused by carbon, where 96% of ocean life died. Thanks, 
deniers, for putting us on that path.   <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/348/6231/229.abstract" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencemag.org/cont...</a></p>

<p>You see, when people stop being religious and believing in one set of
 fire and brimstone endings full of punishment of the wicked they seem 
to need another. I guess it's a human condition to say that the sky is 
falling and it's all the fault of people we don't like. Saying that 
people choosing to live an energy rich lifestyle is going to cause a 
force we don't understand (but arrogantly think we do) to destroy us is 
about as stupid as saying God will destroy us all for accepting 
homosexuality. People just need to think that there is a higher force 
that agrees with them and will punish those that don't.</p>

<p>That was 65,000,000 to 100,000,000 years ago. Ice ages were 12,000

talking 10 degrees Celsius over MILLIONS of years. Now were on track to 
raise it 2-4 degrees over about 100 years. Add that up and it's worth 
looking at.</p>
