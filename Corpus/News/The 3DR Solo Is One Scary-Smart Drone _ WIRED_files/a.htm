<p>If someone discovered a way to create artificial gravitons, they 
would be in the history books, win a nobel prize, and usher in a whole 
new era of humanity.  Here are just a few things that would go from 
dreams to possible overnight with artificial gravitons; warp drive, 
faster that light communication, force fields, wormholes, gravity 
weapons, hoverboards / cars / cities, nextgen 3d printers, time 
distortion fields (imagine that with farming!), nextgen computing, etc. 
  In other words, someone please figure this one out!  </p>

<p>Yea, I know. I am with you. All our best and brightest minds are 
working on kinking power cords and playing with underwater legos instead
 of working on problems like these. Although, something tells me your 
uncle Sam already has pieces of this puzzle figured out with the finale 
in sight. My old man worked for Lockheed Martin Skunk Works as a 
mechanical engineer(50's-60's), and told me about some interestingly 
scary projects he worked on. Ben Rich best said it when he said it would
 take an act of God for any of the black op projects to be used for the 
benefit of mankind.</p>

<p>Hello Ahmay Ahmoo,<br>Generally speaking, the DJI inspires and the 
newest releases from 3DR are reserved for filming snow boarding 
competitions, zip lining in Hawaii, and high altitude yacht shots.  
Because you will be filming a third-world country, may I recommend a 
third tier drone. The Phantom 1 should do the job adequately available 
at Amazon for around $400., and for about $70. U.S. you can't beat the 
Syma X5C-1. Good luck my friend.</p>

<p>Alas, 3DR is strong on Marketing, weak on Operations.  3 weeks since 
my IRIS+ order and still no product because somehow, they can't manage 
to stock the carrying case (because who would ever order a case to

<p>The fact that you can give this thing a flight path so you can 
control the camera sounds pretty awesome to me. What else does that? 
Seriously, I genuinely want to know what other drone can fly itself 
while allowing the operator to just shoot away.</p>

<p>Although the drone has been done, new developments have been made 
which may ultimately improve the photography and accessible vision in 
the capturing of images. i think that enabling access to such 
improvements may be useful to users worldwide. Its incredible how 
technology has advanced just over a matter of years, and continuous 
advancements will not be expected any less going into the future.</p>
