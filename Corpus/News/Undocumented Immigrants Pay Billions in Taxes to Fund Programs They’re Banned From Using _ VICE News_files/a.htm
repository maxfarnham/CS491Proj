This is about the future of the USA and keeping it sustainable for the citizens who are here now and advancing the Indigenous native american people so there race can survive the harsh future thats coming in the centuries ahead. \n\nYour destroying foreigners the opportunity to make their homeland great by telling them to runaway and flee to the United States. The American dream my friend is get Kings and monarchies from ruling over the people. To free the people from the tyranny and to allow all citizens a right to participate in its new government. The French revolutions and the toppling of Napoleon was influence by the US. Just as Mexico from Spain, Brazil from Portugal, Russia from its CZars etc etc It was a domino effect. All throughout the world. That is the USA dream. NOT RUN FOR YOUR LIVES TO USA. It seems that your okay with foreigners to come to the USA but you lack compassion for the indigenous people of north America. They are the VICTIMS...NOT FOREIGNERS. Foreigners have a country they should be trying to make great. Where is your compassion for the indigenous people who have been suppressed for centuries? How do you ignore that this land was stolen from people who have been here for 13,000 plus years? Yet instead of helping them you want to bring more foreigners here to further use up their resources. At a time when sea levels are rising, food is becoming scarcer along with a growing population. The answer is to tell foreigners they need to prepare their homeland to be sustainable for the future centuries. Developed nations around the world citizens are getting more restless with foreigners. Spain, Italy, Greece, Great Britain, France, Germany, Brazil are cracking down on Illegal immigrants and slowing down immigration. Its NOT a USA issue its a GLOBAL issue. A develop nations are cracking down. It only a matter of time. In the USA California is facing a major drought. Thats a huge food resource to the United States Citizens thats taking a major hit. Higher food prices citizens but unaffordable prices for the poor. Native American has the highest poverty rate than any ethnic group. The future property lost in California due to drought and Florida properties due to sea level rising is going to hurt our economy. Sea levels in Florida rose to 6 inches in the last 20 years and are expecting to double by the next 15 to 20. \n\nI don't get how people are willing to show compassion to foreigners but less compassion for the indigenous people of these lands. How about using your energy to CARE to help the victims of the greatest genocide known to humankind. The genocide that reduced a race of people of one DNA strain who's home was ALL THE AMERICA'S. South America North America Central America. A genocide that reduced them down to a fraction of a race. Where is your compassion for them. Why are you so concern with continuing giving away their resources? Why? STOP! Help build them up along with the citizens that are here and lets live in harmony with those natives who we've stolen their resources from. Lets make them a stronger people. The USA dream is for all nations to take back their nations from Kings and tyranny. Not to flee there homeland. That's the dream? Flee your homeland. No! Its a lie. The dream is to do like Anglos and TAKE BACK THEIR FREEDOM.....NOT FLEE. Take back their country from brutal dictators. This is why the FRENCH gave us the Statue of Liberty! For being an example of a people who took back their freedom.

<p>First I live in Texas, heck some times I think Houston / San Antonio / Dallas is the capitol of Mexico. LOL<br>All
 joking aside this is America, we are built on immigration. Everyone in 
this country is a immigrant weather it is one generation or ten 
generations back. <br>The other fact is, the migrant workers are usually
 good hard working people trying to escape the corruption and violence 
in Mexico / other South American countries. They also are usually 
willing to do jobs the "normal" citizens will not do, and for less pay. <br>As
 much as people don't want to admit, we need immigration. Ask farmers, 
ask, landscape, etc, any hard working jobs in the heat they are needed.<br>Here is a fun fact the USA population would be declining like Japan and Russia if we didn't have immigration.<br>We
 can't seal the boarder, politician after politician, even the national 
guard can't stop them from crossing the boarder. FACT. <br>I personally would rather have them paying taxes and contributing to society then not. <br>Seriously
 how much have we spent to lock up good hard working people? Then to fly
 them back to their country (which costs more $) just to see them next 
week?<br>I'm not saying give them instant citizenship, but at least a 
work permit for 5yrs and if they pay taxes, work, contribute to society 
give them citizenship.<br>As long as they are not criminals what really 
is the problem? (We will make more money and the economy will grow 
faster with them then without them) <br>The numbers show the middle class or the working class contributes more to the economy than the upper class (1%) <br>They are going to pay taxes and work hard. Who am I to say they can't experience the same freedoms I do.</p><p>I really can't think of a negative to allow them in. (Unless you are racist?)</p>

<p>Obviously you didn't understand me. The subject of this article is 
tax receipts paid to the government.  That's the type of growth, through
 expansion (ie. spending) that we do not need. The type of expansion 
that allows us to project power overseas. Try to keep up.</p><p>We 
certainly will not be "stronger" by accepting the world illiterate and 
unskilled, because the difference between the immigrant migration today 
vs. the immigrant migration of the past is that the federal government 
controls the education of these immigrants; which allows them to control
 generations of poorly educated, needy, laborers.</p>

<p>Not all people who are here immigrated to the USA. This is a lie. 
English/Anglo migrated to the Northern Americas however they created the
 United States of America. You cannot be an immigrant to a Nation if 
your people created it. The descendants of the earlier settlers and 
colonist are the the USA people/race just as Canadians are. They are 
only immigrants to the Americas but are the original people of USA. This
 notion is an insult to the descendants of those who created this great 
nation. As far as taxes its bad that 40% of  legal citizens actually pay
 taxes. Illegals mostly do not pay taxes. Its risky for businesses and 
the illegals too. You would have to admit your employing illegals. This 
is not just a trend here in the US its an issue all around the world. 
Italy has problem with Chinese illegals and lack of taxes. Spain and 
France its north Africans. Again this article is deceptive and it only 
avoids the major problems...immigrants staying in there home land and 
fighting there government and demand for higher wages, better schooling 
and take up arms against corruption. Running away from the problems in 
South and Central America only further cripples the next generation in 
South and Central America. Instead of taking in illegals we USA citizens
 should demand our nation to help develop our southern neighbors.</p>

<p>North Americans need to stop bringing foreigners into USA and Canada 
at least not until Northern Native American tribes are able to get a

 land, using up fresh water, food and other resources that should be 
going to Native Americans and not foreigners especially not illegals

<p>All I have to say about Natives is, their tribal counsels are fuct. 
Extremely corrupt and very anti industry. Which is the main cause of 
extreme poverty and substance abuse on the reservations in the 
southwest. Investing more money into these un/self regulated counsels 
will only further this corruption. I know many hard working folks that 
are from the Res, but chose to leave to escape the bullshit cycle it 
creates. Source: I worked/lived on a reservation for 9+ years.</p>

 because you QUIT doesn't mean THEY QUIT. THEY ARE FIGHTERS and stop

need USA citizens to fight for them. What they do not need is more

THE NATIVES WE OWE THEM stop redistributing their resources. You could 
sponsor a young native going to college. Mentor young native americans. 
If your sincere about help those in need you don't have to leave the 
shores of North America. Sponsor young Native American's. Sponsor 
reservations. Sponsor tribes with your time. Donate food. Make it your 
tithe to an endangered race/DNA/religion/language/ people. I admit 
throwing money at the problem is not the answer however unless your 
sponsoring those who have the potential to go to college. The best 
volunteers educators, teachers, engineers and people familiar with US 
laws (lawyers) or average americans who can read and write to help 
educate and prepare them for life off of the reservation.</p>

<p>First the reservations are built on unwanted land. Tough land to farm
 with harsh environments. We have corruption in our government and 
communities like they have however we also have the best resources to 
capitalize on for financing our schools, agriculture, medicine etc etc. 
The number one boom that pushed USA was the oil boom. If native 
americans had the boom the USA had which it should have been the Native 
Americans they would have the same resources to build a great nation 
such as the USA. It very disrespectful to judge hundreds of tribal 
nations and call them all corrupt and not highlight the impoverish 
position this nation put them in. No foreigner should be allowed on this
 soil until the US fixes its wrongs and honor its treaties to the Native
 Americans so they can thrive as they once did. This nation is not truly
 whole without the Native American. The usa is Anglo/Native American 
country. This is the foundation of our nation. It is important for our 
identity. They fought along side the British rebels in the civil war of 
1776. They earned their keep. Illegals have no place in this nation. 
Illegals have no place in any nation. Honor all nations own immigration 
laws and laws in general. As far as south and central americans many 
which are indigenous ppl who themselves are the most violent to southern
 and central native american tribes who still hold onto their indigenous
 roots. I seen latin americans bully and drag down their own ancestors. I
 watch how children would beat them in the streets because they refuse 
to speak spanish. ITS SICKENING! The greatest genocide done to any race 
was done to the Native Americans. At least Central and South Americans 
have their own countries run by their own people. It may be violent in 
certain countries but at least they have the luxury to kill each other 
for their own land. You say Native Americans are corrupt so we shouldn't
 help them. If that so I hope your not in favor of South &amp; Central 
Americans Legal or Illegal to reside here because ALL OF THERE 
GOVERNMENTS ARE CORRUPT and they are struggling. How dare you place 
blame on Native Americans for their present lifestyle but willing to 
ignoring that those coming from other countries have more obligation to 
their own homeland and not here the USA.</p>

<p>Lastly calling all tribes corrupt without evidence is flat out 
discriminative and borderline racist. Example. All latin americans who 
flee to the United States can't find jobs in their homeland due to lack 
education and job skills. They can barely speak Spanish and most can't 
write in Spanish. Unfortunately this stereotype is true but none the 
less people shouldn't assume this to all latin americans. Yet these 
problems is not OUR problems. This is fundamental local south American 
government  problems. Latin americans need to stand up and fight for 
their homeland and ultimately be willing to make the ultimate sacrifice.
 To be willing to die to make they homeland great just like the people 
who created the United States of America.</p>

<p>Bush. George W. Bush was one of the most destructive president ever. 
911 the greatest attach on the homeland was under his watch. Before that
 it was the war of 1812 when the British came back and torch Washington 
DC. And that was minimal compared to 911. I also charge Clinton for 
having the Intel from FBI and CIA about Al Queda and Osama but not going
 after him even after they blew up our warship. 911 could have been 
avoided by Clinton and Bush but they ignore the obvious threat. Bush 
ignored our citizens plea for help in the Gulf which crumbled with 
Hurricane Katrina. Awful. Bush ignored the recession. An went as far as 
denying it was happening. Clinton single handedly destroyed an already 
fractured Haiti economy flooding it with inexpensive rice that was grown
 here in the US. Neither President fixed our borders problem. The number
 one form of defense is to secure fort however they both boast that the 
USA is safer under their watch....and then 911. Poor immigration law. 
Weak visa laws and the lack of following up in visa card holders who 
stay after their visa card expires. Leads to the 911 hijackers. Its an 
immigration problem, border problem as well as national/international 
policy problem.</p>

<p>Yep.  That they did not close the border after we were attacked by 
immigrants proves one of two things. 1) we were not actually attacked by
 immigrants or 2) they don't care if this threat exists.  The latter is 
easy to understand - the more danger there is the more power they have.</p>

<p>"Don't be a useful idiot" when human start belittling humans 
especially those they do not know as oppose to arguing out their 
differences with respect. You've become less civil and more primitive 
minded. Lets keep this conversation civil. I'm not Bush and Bush never 
shared this view. He's done little for the indigenous people of this 
land. This is about the future of the USA and keeping it sustainable for
 the citizens who are here now and advancing the Indigenous native 
american people so there race can survive the harsh future thats coming 
in the centuries ahead.</p><p>Your destroying foreigners the opportunity
 to make their homeland great by telling them to runaway and flee to the
 United States. The American dream my friend is get Kings and monarchies
 from ruling over the people. To free the people from the tyranny and to
 allow all citizens a right to participate in its new government. The 
French revolutions and the toppling of Napoleon was influence by the US.
 Just as Mexico from Spain, Brazil from Portugal, Russia from its CZars 
etc etc It was a domino effect. All throughout the world. That is the 
USA dream. NOT RUN FOR YOUR LIVES TO USA. It seems that your okay with 
foreigners to come to the USA but you lack compassion for the indigenous
 people of north America. They are the VICTIMS...NOT FOREIGNERS. 
Foreigners have a country they should be trying to make great. Where is 
your compassion for the indigenous people who have been suppressed for 
centuries? How do you ignore that this land was stolen from people who 
have been here for 13,000 plus years? Yet instead of helping them you 
want to bring more foreigners here to further use up their resources. At
 a time when sea levels are rising, food is becoming scarcer along with a
 growing population. The answer is to tell foreigners they need to 
prepare their homeland to be sustainable for the future centuries. 
Developed nations around the world citizens are getting more restless 
with foreigners. Spain, Italy, Greece, Great Britain, France, Germany, 
Brazil are cracking down on Illegal immigrants and slowing down 
immigration. Its NOT a USA issue its a GLOBAL issue. A develop nations 
are cracking down. It only a matter of time. In the USA California is 
facing a major drought. Thats a huge food resource to the United States 
Citizens thats taking a major hit. Higher food prices citizens but 
unaffordable prices for the poor. Native American has the highest 
poverty rate than any ethnic group. The future property lost in 
California due to drought and Florida properties due to sea level rising
 is going to hurt our economy. Sea levels in Florida rose to 6 inches in
 the last 20 years and are expecting to double by the next 15 to 20.</p><p>I
 don't get how people are willing to show compassion to foreigners but 
less compassion for the indigenous people of these lands. How about 
using your energy to CARE to help the victims of the greatest genocide 
known to humankind. The genocide that reduced a race of people of one 
DNA strain who's home was ALL THE AMERICA'S. South America North America
 Central America. A genocide that reduced them down to a fraction of a 
race. Where is your compassion for them. Why are you so concern with 
continuing giving away their resources? Why? STOP! Help build them up 
along with the citizens that are here and lets live in harmony with 
those natives who we've stolen their resources from. Lets make them a 
stronger people. The USA dream is for all nations to take back their 
nations from Kings and tyranny. Not to flee there homeland. That's the 
dream? Flee your homeland. No! Its a lie. The dream is to do like Anglos
 and TAKE BACK THEIR FREEDOM.....NOT FLEE. Take back their country from 
brutal dictators. This is why the FRENCH gave us the Statue of Liberty! 
For being an example of a people who took back their freedom. A people 
who influence the FRENCH to do the same.</p>

<p>"Don't be a useful idiot" when human start belittling humans 
especially those they do not know as oppose to arguing out their 
differences with respect. You've become less civil and more primitive 
minded. Lets keep this conversation civil. I'm not Bush and Bush never 
shared this view. He's done little for the indigenous people of this 
land. This is about the future of the USA and keeping it sustainable for
 the citizens who are here now and advancing the Indigenous native 
american people so there race can survive the harsh future thats coming 
in the centuries ahead.</p><p>Your destroying foreigners the opportunity
 to make their homeland great by telling them to runaway and flee to the
 United States. The American dream my friend is get Kings and monarchies
 from ruling over the people. To free the people from the tyranny and to
 allow all citizens a right to participate in its new government. The 
French revolutions and the toppling of Napoleon was influence by the US.
 Just as Mexico from Spain, Brazil from Portugal, Russia from its CZars 
etc etc It was a domino effect. All throughout the world. That is the 
USA dream. NOT RUN FOR YOUR LIVES TO USA. It seems that your okay with 
foreigners to come to the USA but you lack compassion for the indigenous
 people of north America. They are the VICTIMS...NOT FOREIGNERS. 
Foreigners have a country they should be trying to make great. Where is 
your compassion for the indigenous people who have been suppressed for 
centuries? How do you ignore that this land was stolen from people who 
have been here for 13,000 plus years? Yet instead of helping them you 
want to bring more foreigners here to further use up their resources. At
 a time when sea levels are rising, food is becoming scarcer along with a
 growing population. The answer is to tell foreigners they need to 
prepare their homeland to be sustainable for the future centuries. 
Developed nations around the world citizens are getting more restless 
with foreigners. Spain, Italy, Greece, Great Britain, France, Germany, 
Brazil are cracking down on Illegal immigrants and slowing down 
immigration. Its NOT a USA issue its a GLOBAL issue. A develop nations 
are cracking down. It only a matter of time. In the USA California is 
facing a major drought. Thats a huge food resource to the United States 
Citizens thats taking a major hit. Higher food prices citizens but 
unaffordable prices for the poor. Native American has the highest 
poverty rate than any ethnic group. The future property lost in 
California due to drought and Florida properties due to sea level rising
 is going to hurt our economy. Sea levels in Florida rose to 6 inches in
 the last 20 years and are expecting to double by the next 15 to 20.</p><p>I
 don't get how people are willing to show compassion to foreigners but 
less compassion for the indigenous people of these lands. How about 
using your energy to CARE to help the victims of the greatest genocide 
known to humankind. The genocide that reduced a race of people of one 
DNA strain who's home was ALL THE AMERICA'S. South America North America
 Central America. A genocide that reduced them down to a fraction of a 
race. Where is your compassion for them. Why are you so concern with 
continuing giving away their resources? Why? STOP! Help build them up 
along with the citizens that are here and lets live in harmony with 
those natives who we've stolen their resources from. Lets make them a 
stronger people. The USA dream is for all nations to take back their 
nations from Kings and tyranny. Not to flee there homeland. That's the 
dream? Flee your homeland. No! Its a lie. The dream is to do like Anglos
 and TAKE BACK THEIR FREEDOM.....NOT FLEE. Take back their country from 
brutal dictators. This is why the FRENCH gave us the Statue of Liberty! 
For being an example of a people who took back their freedom. A people 
who influence the FRENCH to do the same.</p>

<p>Bush. George W. Bush was one of the most destructive president ever. 
911 the greatest attach on the homeland was under his watch. Before that
 it was the war of 1812 when the British came back and torch Washington 
DC. And that was minimal compared to 911. I also charge Clinton for 
having the Intel from FBI and CIA about Al Queda and Osama but not going
 after him even after they blew up our warship. 911 could have been 
avoided by Clinton and Bush but they ignore the obvious threat. Bush 
ignored our citizens plea for help in the Gulf which crumbled with 
Hurricane Katrina. Awful. Bush ignored the recession. An went as far as 
denying it was happening. Clinton single handedly destroyed an already 
fractured Haiti economy flooding it with inexpensive rice that was grown
 here in the US. Neither President fixed our borders problem. The number
 one form of defense is to secure fort however they both boast that the 
USA is safer under their watch....and then 911. Poor immigration law. 
Weak visa laws and the lack of following up in visa card holders who 
stay after their visa card expires. Leads to the 911 hijackers. Its an 
immigration problem, border problem as well as national/international 
policy problem.</p>

<p>KEY WORD IMMIGRATED TO THE AMERICA'S (Native American Continent) BUT 
DID NOT IMMIGRATE TO THE USA WHICH THEY CREATED WITH THEIR BARE HANDS. 
USA is not a continent however The America's is. They lived on the North
 American Continent and built the United Stated of America around them. 
So you can't be a immigrant to something you built with your own hands. 
THE AMERICA'S (continent/God-made/mother earth-made) THE UNITED STATES 
OF AMERICA (Anglo man-made). Its not rocket science. Just slow down and 
think. Were all are immigrants to the continent of America's...unless 
your native. But Anglos/English are the creators of Britain, Canada, 
USA, Gov't of New Zealand and the Gov't of Australia. They are not 
indigenous to any of these areas not even Britain yet they are the 
creators of all these governments...Not Italians, Jew, French, German, 
Kenyans, Brasilians etc etc they are Angle Nations. You can't be a 
immigrant something you've created.  LETS BE SPECIFIC ANGLOS/ANGLES ARE A
 SPECIFIC GERMANIC TRIBE OF PEOPLE. THE ENGLISH. I say this because you 
place European along with anglo however the English resented Europeans 
as well all people who were not English. However this is true of all 
races especially during the 1600's. Yes I can trace my anglo roots to my
 family members who settled and built this nation with their bare hands.
 They fought against their king and brothers and created this great 
nation. Its an Anglo Nation/Native America land. The USA is a perfect 
fusion of the Angles/Native American culture,diet, religion and 
traditions Just as Canada is the same. All others races are here because
 they were granted permission just to be used to further progress those 
who built this nation. Either by indenture servitude or indenture 
servitude for life (slave). Due to famine and poverty in Europe the USA 
again capitalize on cheap labor and granted permission to enter this 
nation AGAIN. The usa "The land of opportunity" was a marketing lie. It 
was a trap to get foreigners to come but once they got here they were 
faced with harsh living and very little legal rights. "The Land of 
opportunity" really wasn't true until the civil rights for all races was
 law. Before then the USA was primarily African freeman and Euro. Our 
nation diversity expanded almost instantaneously after the sixties with 
increase of Eastern Euros, Asians, Euro-Asian, Indo-Asian, Latin 
American and Africans.</p>

<p>I my opinion the melting pot of cultures and races is what makes America, America. <br>The
 tolerance of religion, and many different cultures and the freedom of

<p>Move to California and look at what the Mexican immigrants are doing 
here. they seriously break so many laws here then rather than face the 
consequences they run back to mexico, wait a while then sneak back in 
and break more laws. who do you think is paying for the damage? there 
has got tot be some end at some point or we Americans will pay the price
 for what you are dreaming is fair. the biggest laws they break are 
actually killing Americans, because the Mexicans will buy a used car 
from someone, never register it in their name, get drunk and get in a 
wreck and a lot of times kill people in those accidents then abandon the
 car, leave the scene and go back to mexico till they feel secure enough
 to return. that's totally wrong and you're advocating it.</p>

<p>The USA was great the moment they took power from King George and 
Great Britain. It didn't just become great 50 years ago. And it is a 
nation of diversity just like France, Great Britain and just about every
 nation around the would is multi cultural. If you definition of Great 
is simply multicultural and religious tolerance well Iran, Jordan, China
 has Jews, Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Africans, Asians, Europeans. Are
 you saying USA, Jordan, Iran, China are all equally great to you? USA 
is great because your bias because you reside here. Everyone thinks 
their homeland is great if they find success in there homeland. You will
 find even poor people in their foreign land would rather stay than 
leave to the USA. I do not know who you are or where you are from, 
however I find it more and more annoying when people do not have respect
 for the people who created this nation. Foreigners who do not the 
struggle and sacrifice blood n gut to make this nation great. To turn 
against your King. To create a government that has never existed before.
 That's what makes USA great. We have been great the moment we were 
born.</p><p>To go to a restaurant which specialize making dishes from 
around the world but under USA its Italian Sausage. Italian Sausage in 
English/Native American Nation. Its flat out ignorance. The owners are 
Geogian's who clearly no nothing of USA culture. English. We were at war
 with Italy about 60 years ago. We lost many men. Generations of men 
still affecting families who lost land and property. Yet USA cuisine is 
now Italian. That's ignorance that comes from a steady flow of 
foreigners who do not respect our nation.</p><p>I love the diversity in 
my country don't get me wrong but when do you say "wait there is another
 group of people who we owe and need to honor" under our 
contracts/treaties that a single President ignored (Andrew Jackson). Let
 me remind you President Jackson also is about to be replaced on the $20
 dollar bill. Were no longer honoring him as we did in the past for what
 he did to native americans.</p><p>When do we say wait this is all 
wrong. How can we right the wrongs that our ancestors/US citizens have 
done to the indigenous people? The answer is not to bring more 
foreigners. I would love to see more native american and English in this
 nation but clearly more native americans by far. That is the culture of
 the USA English-British/Native American not Italian not French not Iran
 not Saudi not China. That's the history and story of the USA. It you 
want something else then go visit other nations.</p>

<p>Seriously Dude, move to California and witness what Gordon R is 
talking about first hand. He is absolutely correct. I am not going to 
argue this with you, because you do not see this in your home town on a

<p>There is no negative unless we live in Sweden and cannot control your
 immigration policy. However, you cannot deny that illegals should 
follow the guidelines and face punishment. If you feel the you can go 
around the immigration policy and come illegally, you have no right to 
complain if you get caught. Illegal acts warrant punishment decided by 
society.</p><p>America wouldn't end up like Japan or Russia because both
 are more racist than America, Japan is one of the most racist countries
 on Earth. America, however isn't really racist, I'm not saying we don't
 have racism problems, we do, but... we still take in most immigrants on
 Earth. America would do just fine without illegals thinking they don't 
need to go through customs.</p><p>They shouldn't have less freedom if 
they come legally. If you come to another country legally, you can't 
experience the full benefits, because you are now a criminal and now 
you're facing the punishments. If you can't access all of the services 
because you're an illegal immigrant, that's your problem for breaking 
the law.</p>

<p>Pray tell, how is Sweden better than America? I can say Canada is 
better than off than Sweden. Saying things without expanding helps no 
one. Sweden renamed a bunch of birds, and a crap ton of crime in Sweden 
is caused by immigrants. Again, I'm not saying America doesn't have 
problems, but the way Sweden is handling their immigration is total 
crap.</p>

<p>I agree, and I must have not articulated my thoughts very well.<br>The USA have a very rigorous and stringent process to even get a work visa. <br>I
 also agree, they need to do it legally 100%. (Thus my point saying as 
long as they are not criminals) And there to be a period of working and 
living in the country before we give them full citizenship. <br>I also agree to your point on Russia and Japan. I didn't go into detail but yes that is one of the reasons of many.</p><p>The
 USA is becoming more and more like Japan and Russia as far as 
immigration policy. I'm not a dem or repub (Personally I think all 
politicians are POS) I vote for who ever best fits my values at the 
time. <br>With that being said the repubs are the ones usually against any form of immigration. Or making hard to do.</p><p>My
 point was there should be a realistic way for people to have a fair 
opportunity to live and work in this country and have the same freedoms 
and rights I do. (currently is not the case)</p><p>So I think we are on the same page?</p>

Sad......</p><p>You do know you are a hypocrite?<br>The same freedoms your ancestors or you came here with, now you are rejecting.<br>Not
 sure what your point was on posting that link? Yes that is a not very 
common, horrible and traumatic experience  that took place. There are 
natural USA citizens that have done those types of crimes as well. What 
is your point?<br>If the boarder would have been more open then I'm sure
 they would have had him in the system, but since he was here illegally 
now they don't even know where to find him. Good job! (Sarcasm) being 
able to screen more of them BEFORE they come into the country. What part
 of that are you not understanding? So then there will be only the 
criminals trying to illegally enter which in turn make life easier for 
boarder patrol and LEOs.<br>Everyone has done something illegal at some point in their life to go to jail. (Even YOU)<br>Yet you are so easy to judge others. <br>Your comments shows your true character (Not good in my opinion)</p>

<p>You keep referring to ancestors who migrated here, that is now apples
 to oranges, back then the immigrants HAD to learn American history, the
 bill of rights, the declaration of independence and had to learn to 
speak English. Now we Americans HAVE to learn to speak Spanish in order 
to accommodate these Mexican immigrants, so how is that right for past 
immigrants ? and why do we have to foot the bill for this? it wasn't 
that way in the history of the early immigrants. stay away from that 
point. stop referring to past immigrants because they honored the law. 
the new ones don't.</p>
