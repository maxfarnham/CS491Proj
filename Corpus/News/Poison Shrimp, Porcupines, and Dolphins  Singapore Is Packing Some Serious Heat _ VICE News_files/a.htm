<p>What would be the point for any neighbouring country to invade 
Singapore? Singapore's economic value is in its know-how, 
infrastructure, services, political system and confidence in its legal

left (for the foreign powers) that would be worthwhile to start a war 
for.</p>

<p>And our United States burned dozens of large Japanese cities and 
their population into ashes, so many that General Curtis LeMay told 
Robert McNamara that if the US had been the side that lost, they would 
be on trial as war criminals. We literally chose Hiroshima and Nagasaki 
as the two targets for atomic bombs because they and Kyoto were the only
 meaningful cities left undamaged in a country of 70,000,000 people. I'm
 not saying the options were better; I'm saying that was a fantastically
 savage act carried out with total enthusiasm.</p>

<p>what's more interesting is singapore is smack in the middle of the 
biggest islamic population of the planet. Malaysia has ban the word 
Allah for non-muslims and indonesia is probably close to full blown

passing over muslim air-space. Also singapore military was trained by 
the Israelis.</p>

 El-air. Are a few hundred million Muslims in Southeast Asia supposed to
 change their religion because El Al would like them to? El Al doesn't 
fly to Tokyo, Shanghai or Seoul either - too many Muslims there?</p>

<p>DARPA has a whole littoral combat Unmanned Surface Vessel strategy 
for the brown water navies of the future. Singapore is going to be flush
 with robotic surface vessels, little pocket robot battleships that can 
easily outrun and outmaneuver anything they cant outshoot.<br>Outfitted 
with fuel cells, solar panels, micro reactors, and wielding a power 
laser using new fiber coupling and spectrum combination, you have a 
force multiplier and an entire picket line ready to be deployed by the 
thousands, millions, if necessary. Completely autonomous, completely 
expendable, completely incorruptible and eternally vigilant. The perfect
 seaman!</p>

<p>What makes you so sure that such technologies will never be used 
against the US and its fantastically overblown commitments to 130 other 
countries?  The Singaporeans are cynical arms merchants, and so are all 
of the other rich arms exporters.  Only the US places so many 
ideological strings on its arms sales.  But beyond that, you seem to 
assume that only people who share your cultural agenda are capable of 
making and operating these weapons.  The logic of capitalism is to 
maximize profits; that is done by having the poorest possible people in 
sweatshops making the most advanced possible technology.  And much of 
that technology has military implications.  This is like the 19th 
century racist empires that believed only the superior white race could 
make and use machine guns - which would contribute to their downfall.  
Imagine a sweatshop full of kids building V-1 buzz bombs equipped with 
GPS systems (whose chips are already built in poor countries).  Figure 
about $10,000 to carry a two-ton warhead.  We are about to be inundated 
by civilian drone technology, hundreds of millions of devices, and every
 damn one built in China or someplace even poorer.  This would not 
appear to a historian to be a sustainable imbalance in power.</p>

<p>The Wing In Ground Effect boats and ships do offer fast and heavy 
vehicles capable of power reach have been ignored for the most part.  
I've read of them as used in the Mediterranean, which has calm waters.  
Swarm tactics are developed as Janes reports.  In future needs of the US
 the Wing in Ground effect ships and boats will be required for force 
projection and troop and equipment carriage.  For Singapore in conflicts
 with pirates the capacity of being able to do more with less will 
demand sea craft never quite anticipated.  I believe they have the tech.</p>

<p>The reason Wing In Ground development should never have been 
abandoned is because surface warships are dead men walking.  Whatever 
goes only 40 mph is going to get overwhelmed by robot missiles, 
torpedoes and hybrids built in countries that made that crappy Android 
tablet on your table.  So what if many of them fail?  However, I think 
it's too late even for WIG vehicles to deliver troops against the things
 that are coming.</p>
