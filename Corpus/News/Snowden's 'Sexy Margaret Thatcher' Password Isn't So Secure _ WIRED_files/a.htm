The other commentators are correct that a 27 Character mixed case password with punctuation would take 8.04 hundred thousand trillion trillion centuries to brute force, assuming no smart algorithm, and yet is impossibly week should you know that the sexual allure of the ex PM is a password thing. Unfortunately what wired et-al fails to address a solution.

P(defense A or defense B) = P(defense A)+P(defense B) - P(defense A and defense B). Which is just saying a defense working with a password and a text key code is much higher than just a text key code.  They can have the password, but then actually fail at still getting in because of the second layer. But this is still based on a static password. If one could count the number of ways to provide security access between entity A and entity B, I'm sure it would be past trillion member set. Passwords are just one way. But the Multi-Layer perspective gives a framework at choosing a structural foundation for good choices.  So for example the FBI confiscates a computer to hack. The whole framework is that one enters a password for the password or encryption. And they might have got that by some crafty means. But if it has mutli layers, and something unfamiliar to them it becomes vastly more less likely for success. And thats the whole deal with P(A or B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A&B).. and when P(A&B) falls to near 0 or 0, then the chances of successful defense are being added. I think Snowden would do better to redefine the password. If he remembers an array of numbers, then the server could flash him a pattern, then from his password array the password is based on that pattern. Now if someone somehow got the password, its only good for that 1 entry or till that pattern shows up again. Next time he goes to log in, there another pattern that flashes. So the password entered in is not the actual password, but based on the array and pattern.. giving it a dynamic changing ability which would require a much longer period of observation to get past.

<p>That tool doesn't analyze the password as a whole. I breaks it down 
into individual patterns, analyzes how long it would take to crack those
 smaller parts, and then adds it all together. It says right in the 
documentation that zxcbn "assumes attackers already know the structure 
(for example, surname-bruteforce-keypad), and from there, it calculates 
how many guesses they’d need to iterate through." I don't know about 
you, but if I was trying to crack a hash I wouldn't just assume from the
 beginning that all passwords follow a 
female_names+surnames+english_word+english_word+known_passwords pattern 
and then wait up to 7 days to see if I was correct. If I knew it was 
that pattern, then Snowden's password would have 33.041 bits of entropy.
 Otherwise, the entropy would be considerably higher (&gt;100 bits).</p>

 complexity. You wouldn't want to use it now that it's been a public

<p>Consider the possibility that Edward Snowden may not in fact have a 
"thing" for Margaret Thatcher. An idea in vogue some (a good few) years 
ago was that a good passphrase might consist of "shocking nonsense" - 
and there are those who might say that Snowden's passphrase falls into 
that category :-)</p>

<p>Do you even Wired bro? This is literally the most critical thing I've
 seen them write about the man, which says a lot. Believe me when I say 
wired and Edward Snowden could not be more politically compatible. To 
the point where they even gave him a supremely favorable cover shoot of 
him clutching an American flag.</p>

<p>Even though this was a humerus exchange (at least on Edward's side) 
it has something to say about security and the perception of strength in
 passwords. The other commentators are correct that a 27 Character mixed
 case password with punctuation would take 8.04 hundred thousand 
trillion trillion centuries to brute force, assuming no smart algorithm,
 and yet is impossibly week should you know that the sexual allure of 
the ex PM is a password thing. Unfortunately what wired et-al fails to 
address a solution. Because by their and any reasonable definition a 
strong password is not a memorable password (especially if the service 
limits the length allowed, to keep the service call volume down), also 
that each service requiring a password MUST be given a different one.</p><p>So by way of some food for thought here are a few options the reader may try:-</p><p>a)
 Use a password safe (Lastpass, KeyPass etc), have a single strong 
passphrase to unlock it. Generate maximum length random Alphanumeric and
 punctuation passwords for each site and use the password safe to 
remember them.</p><p>b) Use a strong password generating algorithm that can be run offline ( <a href="https://www.grc.com/OffTheGrid.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.grc.com/OffTheGrid...</a>
 ) and used with the sites domain as input to generate strong 
deterministic passwords. Optionally store these in a password safe as 
above for convenience.</p><p>c) Use multi-factor authentication as a backup to a less than totally strongpassword.</p><p>d)
 Push your most important services to offer an alternative 
authentication system that does not need any secret information like a 
password to be stored by the service but relies on psudononymous 
site-specific zero knowledge proofs. i.e. in the near future SQRL ( <a href="http://sqrl.pl/guide/" rel="nofollow">http://sqrl.pl/guide/</a> ) and FIDO ( <a href="https://fidoalliance.org/" rel="nofollow">https://fidoalliance.org/</a> )</p>

<p>Considering how much work Snowden had to do just to educate Greenwald
 on the basics of security this wasn't a bad example to help Greenwald 
understand.  Sure it conveys an incomplete set of information; however, 
this kind of password was <i>surely</i> better than what Greenwald was using at the time.  I sure hope Greenwald has a better password than this now.</p>

<p>First of all, the article fails to point out the difference in 
situation between Greenwald and Poitras. Greenwald was a well known 
activist/reporter but was not high profile as he was post Snowden, and 
thus likely not actively targeted. Poitras, on the other hand, was very 
high profile as early as 2006, stating "I've been placed on the 
Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) watch list" and have been 
notified by airport security "that my 'threat rating' was the highest 
the Department of Homeland Security assigns." Snowden had already tried 
once to contact Greenwald but couldn't get him to use encryption at all.
 Knowing Laura was already of high interest to the intelligence agencies
 and that they would be specifically targeting anything they could 
easily encrypt, he told her to assume "a trillion guesses a second." In 
coaxing Greenwald, and in this case, the general public, into adopting 
the practice, Snowden opted to make it more manageable and memorable, 
after all, the amount of entropy recommended in this article would be 
forgotten by a novice, whereas the one Snowden suggested would stay with
 you forever. I am quite certain that Snowden has taught Greenwald to 
use a much more secure password and that no documents were transmitted 
over the contextually "weak" password. There is no need for the average 
member of the public to assume all the governments computing resources 
will ever get focused on their communications, and hackers or other 
nefarious individuals will go for much easier targets. If you think 
you'll get average Americans to adopt encryption or strong passwords 
using the demands in this article...it's not going to happen. Snowden 
knows that as well.</p>

<p>Right, that's definitely not what I meant to imply, especially since I
 wouldn't take security advice from a politician either. If Bruce 
Schneier was in the same situation as Snowden I'd question why we're 
taking advice from him, even though he's arguably one of the world's 
most renown security experts. I wasn't questioning his credibility as a 
security professional, rather the ethics of even establishing a 
communications channel with someone who commits treason. Obtaining a 
government security clearance is a big deal. If he didn't have a 
clearance and was just an average Joe I might see him as a whistle 
blower instead.</p>

yourself.  Or don't and continue to wallow in willful ignorance.</p><p>Snowden
 may have violated the Espionage Act of 1917, but he did not commit 
Treason.  That is a point only disputed by the ignorant.</p>

<p>Categorically incorrect. Snowden committed the most exceptionally damaging treason in US history in fact.</p><p>But
 people like you are so myopic that I'm not surprised by your inability 
to parse that. You all point to the domestic surveillance and say "see? 
OMG whistleblower!" yet manage to somehow ignore the fact that he *also*
 compromised every last technical foreign intelligence collection 
program we had. He very literally GUTTED our defense apparatus. For more
 information, please try Google.</p><p>One way or another, Edward 
Snowden is going to die screaming. It'll be like the sound of angels 
singing, and I for one would fall to my knees, weeping openly with 
thanksgiving and joy at the rarity and preciousness of living to hear 
such a beautiful sound.</p><p>If you take every last turncoat in US 
history as a collective, they don't hold a candle to Snowden's betrayal.
 The price for that is high... and the bill will come due. :)</p>

<p>You're a confident fool, but you're still a fool.  Watch the video.  
It explains why it is literally impossible for Snowden to have committed
 treason.  It is literally impossible for anyone to commit treason in 
2015 and that has been the case since September 2, 1945.  What is 
significant about that date?  That is the last time the US had a 
Congressional declaration of war.  That was the end of WWII.</p><p>The 
Rosenbergs, who spied for the USSR during the Cold War, were not charged
 with treason.  They were charged with espionage.  Why?  It's not like 
the government was going easy on them.  They were executed.  They 
weren't charged with treason because it was impossible to commit treason
 without a Congressional declaration of war.  That's why Snowden has 
been charged with espionage, not treason.</p><p>The video I linked 
explains this better than I have.  If you watch it, you'll feel an 
emotion.  That emotion will embarrassment because you are a fool and 
you've exposed your foolishness for the entire world to see.</p>

<p>Ok, the video brings up some great points about the interpretation of
 the Constitution on the definition of treason by the supreme court. 
Good thing I'm not prosecuting him. Sure, he might not be guilty of 
treason according to the law, but his alleged crimes are on par with the
 seriousness of the issue, ie: espionage. Either way, what was said 
before still applies, whether you want to nitpick about the definition 
of treason or not. Thanks for the Constitutional lesson, I'll be sure to
 be more correct on choice of words concerning treason and espionage in 
the future.</p>

don't consider what Snowden did as treason since I do not like being

<p>People in general, no, I would agree with you on that. But people who
 swear an oath in order to obtain a security clearance, yes. If we allow
 people like Snowden to indiscriminately distribute classified 
materials, then it makes security clearance a useless tool in protecting
 the security of the United States. I love a transparent government, but
 some things, in the hands of our adversaries, can be very damaging to 
the protection of American livelihood (and lives). That needs to be 
secured in some way. By breaking that trust, you're only endangering the
 livelihood of all 320 million Americans.</p><p>The information that was
 leaked is eye opening, to say the least, and it does break the trust 
Americans have in the US government. But what about all the other 
information that endangers us all. There were other ways to go about his
 goals, he chose the most damaging route.</p>

<p>Snowden chose the only route that would actually get any attention.  
Many others have tried "working within the system" and failed.  They 
failed because the system is broken.  The system silences and punishes 
anyone who tries to expose government misconduct.  With a system so 
opaque, so restrictive, so perverse, it was inevitable that people were 
going to do what Manning and Snowden have done.</p><p>The best way to 
stop future leaks is not to impose further restrictions and harsher 
penalties, it is to make it possible to affect change from the inside.  
Until that happens, until our government stops trying to crush all 
dissent, there will be more leaks.  And the leaks will be even bigger.  
That is as inevitable as the sunrise.</p>

<p>Snowden is not a mere fugitive; he's now fugitive to Russia who 
openly participated last year in "hot line with Putin" pony show where 
he threw him a question whether anything like he uncovered could have 
happened in Russia, to which Putin predictably replied that of course 
not.</p><p> I'd say that stuff like this alone disqualifies him.</p>

<p>Look, any security annalist will tell you that very few and I mean 
less than 1% of 1% of the people out here are will to take on password 
management like they are supposed to. I myself was advising people 10 
years ago  to not think of a password as a word but as a phrase that 
made no since and it had to have special characters in it. As of 2010 I 
had begun advice people to use non-word passphrases. Something along the
 line of Ty2a9X#9v$L32 and to make it very secure they needed to change 
it every other month. Even to make it more memorial for them was to 
create their own system such as ( iWbn50o8-07 ) whicvh is "I was born in
 1950 on august 7th ". Everyone I suggested this to was adamant about 
not doing this. In 2012 after I learned a bit about what Snowden brought
 out (yes, I found out about the government monitoring long before 
Snowden) I even upgraded my own system and began recommending that 
others do the same thing. People just don't care. They want easy, they 
want convenience. And the under 30 crowd don't even care what the 
government knows, till they find out how open they have been.<br>You can
 never consider that you understand enough of what the government is 
doing. You must ALWAYS think ahead of the curve and out of the box.</p>

<p>can i have your picture and an autograph?  i will place it alongside 
the hundreds of others from people that claim to have beat Snowden to 
the punch.  so easy to make that claim in hindsight, isn't it?  if you 
had really been so prescient then you would have done something about 
your views long before Snowden.</p>

<p>This is actually the first article I've ever read about passwords 
lol, but honestly, I never realised people regularly use words in 
passwords?  I always just used completely random numbers, letters (big 
and small) and symbols.  Wouldn't this approach make for safer 
passwords?  Or it doesn't really matter after a certain level of 
characters / complexity?   It'll be interesting to hear.</p>

<p>Or a better idea, is add a biometric check, so not only does access 
require the entire sequence, but the system also checks to see if you 
match parts of the sequence, so if you used your birthdate, the system 
would also have to be able to validate that is your your actual 
birthdate.   Then even if they figured that part out, only 1 in 365 
people (or even less if using combinations of years), could enter the 
key sequence into the system, but then you have problems of attempts at 
taking over an individual thinking they will tell you that there hare is

<p>Well the whole idea of a single layer password is inherently a bad 
foundation. P(defense A or defense B) = P(defense A)+P(defense B) - 
P(defense A and defense B). Which is just saying a defense working with a
 password and a text key code is much higher than just a text key code. 
 They can have the password, but then actually fail at still getting in 
because of the second layer. But this is still based on a static 
password. If one could count the number of ways to provide security 
access between entity A and entity B, I'm sure it would be past trillion
 member set. Passwords are just one way. But the Multi-Layer perspective
 gives a framework at choosing a structural foundation for good choices.
  So for example the FBI confiscates a computer to hack. The whole 
framework is that one enters a password for the password or encryption. 
And they might have got that by some crafty means. But if it has mutli 
layers, and something unfamiliar to them it becomes vastly more less 
likely for success. And thats the whole deal with P(A or B) = 
P(A)+P(B)-P(A&amp;B).. and when P(A&amp;B) falls to near 0 or 0, then 
the chances of successful defense are being added. I think Snowden would
 do better to redefine the password. If he remembers an array of 
numbers, then the server could flash him a pattern, then from his 
password array the password is based on that pattern. Now if someone 
somehow got the password, its only good for that 1 entry or till that 
pattern shows up again. Next time he goes to log in, there another 
pattern that flashes. So the password entered in is not the actual 
password, but based on the array and pattern.. giving it a dynamic 
changing ability which would require a much longer period of observation
 to get past. So even if they knew 4 or 5 pattern keys, Snowden would 
still have a pretty good chance of his account being safe.  Which would 
be good for admin levels, where people have strong ability to use 
alternative access checking methods.</p>
