<p>Australia buying drones from the U.S is a bad mistake on a number of 
levels.  Our government has spent the last 18 months trying to push 
through an unpopular budget packed with austerity measures that target 
education, industry, health and welfare.  treasurer Joe Hockey has also 
announced planned tax increases for the middle class.  In this 
atmosphere of fiscal sensitivity why are we committing billions of 
dollars to buying F-35 fighter jets from the U.S, and building 
submarines overseas?  Even considering spending money on unneeded reaper
 drones when you are raising taxes seems a bit irresponsible.  I'm sure 
the money could be invested in something that will help to grow our 
economy, rather than an asset that will only depreciate in value before 
it needs to be replaced.  <br>Indonesia is the only country within range
 of our borders that these drones could be used to directly benefit our 
national security.  Indonesia is a large country that is fiercely 
protective of its sovereignty, and is one of our closest trading 
partners and allies.  It is not in Australia's best interests to piss 
off the largest Muslim population on the planet especially as it lies 
directly to the north.  We would have a better outcome working with 
Indonesia to combat extremism, as we did after the Bali bombings which 
crippled Jemah Islamiah.<br>The third point I wish to make is to point 
out that the Australian military has very rarely gone to war for reasons
 that directly affect Australia.  Both Iraq and Afghanistan are wars 
that had no strategic gains for us and made the country a target for 
terrorism.  If we were to buy these drones they would more than likely 
be used in a token effort in the next war America drags us into.<br>There are many more reasons to not buy these drones.<br>In
 closing I am starting to feel that if we are the kind of country that 
buys remote controlled planes to drop bombs on people that don't 
remotely pose a valid threat to our nation, maybe we are the real 
terrorists after all.</p>

<p>Drone strikes. Yeah we blew your grandmother to bits right in front of the grandchildren. Now who's the terrorist?<br>Terrorism
 is only violence that we don't like or approve of. If you think we can 
terrorize most of the planet with our drones and bombs and not have it 
come back again like it did on 9/11, please explain how that will work?</p>

<p>The penetration depth in water for radio frequency photons is only a couple millimeters so a foil hat isn't necessary.</p><p>If
 you see a modern skyscraper fall into itself with almost no deflective 
dispersion due to internal resistance, no tipping, no twisting, at near 
free fall acceleration. and you think that was an accident then you need
 a dunce hat. I'm not saying it was the lizard people, Elvis Presley, 
"terrorists", or the CIA that did it. All I'm saying is that it's 
painfully obvious that WTC7 fell due to a controlled demolition.</p><p>Doesn't anybody know any physics anymore?</p>

<p>Conducting drone raids over territory that is not yours is a bad 
thing, yes. From TFA:  "There's no reason an armed drone is any more or 
less threatening than an armed F-111 fighter bomber." If Australia tried
 to fly its bombers in Indonesian territory, Indonesia would have every 
right to shoot them down. Likewise if they tried it with drones. It is 
not Australia's job (nor the US) to conduct any military action in any 
other country, without their prior invitation.</p>

invade his country but he just never did. Finally, we have to be rude

rudely interrupting thier brutal dictatorship. Oh, well, ces le guerre.</p>

<p>The difference there being America actually declared war, which 
technically made it legal, even though the only threat to America was 
economical. America hasn't declared war on Pakistan, or Yemen, or 
Somalia, for example. Yet you still conduct drone attacks in those 
countries. What's more, you and I both know that the wars you conducted 
in Iraq had nothing to do with who was in charge and everything to do 
with oil. You spent (much, much) more than 25 billion on the wars 
themselves, and certainly caused more economic and physical damage than 
that, not to mention the thousands upon thousands of civilians killed. 
1.3 million civilian deaths caused by the "war on terror" is the latest 
UN count. <br>Also, it's c'est la guerre. War is feminine.</p>
