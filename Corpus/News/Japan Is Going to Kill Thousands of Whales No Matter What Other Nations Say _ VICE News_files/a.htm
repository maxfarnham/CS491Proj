<p>Than what exactly is the point in killing them?  From a biology 
standpoint, you dont need to kill 4,000 minke whale to "ostensibly 
study" their age at sexual maturity?  A fraction of that number would 
suffice if you were really interested in studying life history 
characteristics.  Also, you wouldn't have fleets of harpoon ships 
followed by factory ships if you their were no financial incentive in 
killing them?  Why even process them if you're simply aging whales and 
determining sexual maturity?  Also, scientist have gone to Japanese fish
 markets and collected tissue samples for DNA.  They have found whale 
meat being sold, but I'm sure you think its some sort of international 
conspiracy to make Japan look like a bag of dicks.  What really blows my
 mind is that Japan of all nations treats the oceans with zero respect 
even though they rely so heavily on its bounty.  Exploitation of ocean 
fish stocks is leading us on an irreversible path, and two billion 
people who rely on fish as their main source of protein are going to be 
lying in the wake.  Japan is part of the problem, as are many nations, 
not part of the solution.  I think it would help if people were to 
actually admit their own culpability in the situation. We only study 
ecology, its real whether we choose to accept it or not.</p>

<p>Love to kill them? That claim is highly unfounded. Just saying, they

whales is completely irrational and idiotic.</p>

<p>Actually, it IS needed, from a conservation perspective.  You can 
find reams of published scientific evidence to support the moratorium.  
Let's call a spade a spade here: You are a right wing troll, who would 
never have the courage to come piss on my liberal leg, but you have no 
problem trying to rile up the Left from the security of your cyber 
foxhole.  Good on ya, mate.  What a raison d'être!</p>

<p>You like to condescend but your "emotional weak" argument is wearing 
thin.  Those that care are much stronger than those who don't. It's easy
 to call people too emotional.  It's a moral issue as well as a 
conservation issue.</p>

<p>It would be a moral and a conservation issue if there were genuine 
concerns around sustainability and animal cruelty. Those two factors are
 not material in the case of whaling, especially relative to other meat 
sources.</p><p>Given the absence of those factors, it is simply an 
emotional and sentimental issue. You like whales, others like to eat 
whales. That's all.</p>

<p>Minke whales are in fact present in similar if not larger amounts 
than pre-industrial whaling period, which in turn appears to be causing 
increasing decline of other whale types as they are simply outcompeting 
them for the same habitat due to their massively inflated numbers.</p><p>When
 this happens to wildlife, most states typically issue hunt permits to 
contol population of species that is overly competitive to give others a
 chance. Whales have been an exception to this rule mainly for 
sentimental reasons.</p>

<p>For some species, such as the blue whale and southern right whale, 
that is indeed the case. For others, such as the minke, it is not. Minke
 whales exist in tremendous abundance and their populations can easily 
withstand a small regulated harvest such as that proposed by Japan. That
 fact should be held quite separate from any fondness one might have for
 whales in general.</p>

<p>One thing that you and this article left out is that Japan is not 
only killing the Minke, they also hunt all other species of the 
balaenopteridae family of which the minke is a part of, like Fin, 
Humback, Brydes, Sei and yes even the occasional Blue. They will kill 
any whale they come across with no regard for its species and claim it 
is being done for science. Yet their research shows nothing, we have 
learned more in recent years of modern non-lethal research than Japan 
has shown in the last 30 years with the death of 14,000 whales. Japans 
dockside freezer storage is backed logged with frozen meat from years of
 killing because no one wants to eat them, especially since the levels 
of mercury poisoning in the meat has shown that is one of the worst 
things you can eat. The Japanese people are too educated on the subject 
to want to eat it, the market for it does not exist. Also you say that 
minke whales are abundant enough to withstand the hunts yet their true 
population numbers are not known and are only roughly estimated. Without
 that basic knowledge we cannot know the true impact the hunts have on 
the ecology of the species and their environment. I'm sorry but your 
argument holds no water.</p>

<p>nice try.<br>just because they're being called on fake science, 
doesn't make the general argument a science based one.

<p>I'm not familiar with this phrase "eat a bean". But I gather it is intended as some sort of derogatory dismissal.</p><p>But
 what you're ultimately saying is that you have a fondness for whales 
and you would like to impose your preference that they not be killed 
upon others on the basis of some vague notions of intelligence and 
specialness.</p><p>If someone from a far away place arrived at that same
 baseless conclusion with regards to whatever foodstuffs you happened to
 enjoy eating, how do you suppose you would respond?</p>

<p>It isn't in fact needed for many types of whales.</p><p>The hilarious
 hypocricy of current whaling regime is that it's causing some of the 
whales to go into near extinction because they are being massively 
displaced by other whales that had their populations outcompete them for
 the same habitat.</p><p>I.e. the minke whales that form bulk of what 
Japanese whalers hunt have been conclusively shown to have largely 
displaced several other species of whales that are in severe danger, yet
 there's wide ranged insistence that we do not hunt minke whales.</p><p>It's quite a hypocritical form of "mercy".</p>

<p>You , again, are wrong.  Whales are dwindling and many people around 
the globe abhor the inhumaness of the killing.  The moratorium is 
because Japan cannot prove the killing is needed for science.  If it 
isn't needed for science, given dwindling numbers of whales and 
international push back against whaling, they shouldn''t do it at all.  
There is no need for it scientifically or for food.</p>

<p>That's a good point. Krill stocks are actually under significant

 to the ecosystem than whales will ever be.</p>

<p>Sorry to be a stickler for details, but that's not what the 
moratorium is for at all. The moratorium was a temporary measure put in 
place to allow the recovery of whale stocks to the point at which they 
could again withstand a commercial harvest. We have long since reached 
that point, but the moratorium remains in place due to the ideological 
opposition of anti-whaling countries.</p><p>Stocks of minke and humpback
 whales are exploding and are ideally positioned for a regulated 
commercial harvest. You might not like it, but it doesn't change the 
fact.</p>

<p>you assume those arguing in defense of these animals are meat-eaters.</p><p>we
 are concerned about the pigs. there is no pick and choose. thanks for 
attempting to call out the hypocrisy, but the reference to the other 
animals is only made in an attempt for those to make the distinction to 
understand it. and then see that there shouldn't be one. so yes you are 
correct on that.</p>

<p>Exactly.  The "non-sentimental" crowd, loves to try to shut people 
down that way.  It is a distraction tech.  People that think they're 
tough for grinning away at animal suffering have a lot more serious 
issues than sentimentality.</p>

<p>Yes, arbitrary.</p><p>Except for the mirror tests. Or how they use 
lower-pitched, slower sounds during human interaction. Or how some orca 
pods have different "speech patterns" and mannerisms from each other. Or
 how orcas and dolphins have had systematic cooperation with fishermen.</p><p>Or
 any other display of intelligence (if not sapience). that can by found
