<p>"It is what gives the government the authority ask companies to hand over “any tangible things” that pertain to terrorism."<br>...<br>"Ask"?
  Anyone has the authority to ask.... like the pretty please with sugar 
on top kind of ask.  The difference is that the government has given 
itself the authority to DEMAND any records you have and use force to 
throw you in jail if you don't hand it over.  Oh and you can't even 
complain publicly about the government coming in and taking all your 
private records because telling anyone about it is a crime too.   Just 
ask the librarians.</p><p>This heinous law is completely contrary to the
 fourth amendment of the Bill of Rights and undermines every freedom we 
have fought for centuries to secure.</p>

<p>Warrant less wiretaps were allowed between 1928 and 1967, with 
meta-data singled out as not requiring a warrant because it was 
information freely given to the phone company, who then owned it in a 
court case in 1979. This was all codified in the Electronic 
Communications Privacy Act of 1986 where meta data was identified as Pen
 Registers</p><p>Since that time the use of Pen Registers has been a 
primary means of detecting criminal networks and setting the probable 
cause for further warrants to allow wiretaps</p><p>It is important to 
understand the history behind these laws in order to realize that this 
has been going on for much longer than the Patriot Act. There have been 
other information networks in operation since WW2 that have had legal 
access to all communications that cross national borders, Echelon was a 
closely held secret that was first mentioned in the press in the mid 
80's.</p><p>Anybody who was surprised by snowden's revelations what simply not paying attention</p>

It did not reflect well on the politician and as a result Congress 
passed laws giving protection to cell phone traffic in very short order</p><p>Similarly,
 somebody leaked the pay per view purchases at a hotel that was in a 
city where a Christian Coalition convention was happening. In a 
similarly short time pay per view purchases were protected information</p><p>It seems that we can expect laws to be passed to protect private information when it touches politically influential people</p><p>In
 the mean time encryption is key. In an oddly related note, a former

they controlled</p>

<p>Although, of course, the government can demand a warrant for national
 security reasons without having to explain any of the who what or why. 
And, really, the protections on cell phones aren't so strong they 
government can't get through them, not to mention all the security 
protocols which they have, hmm, gently suggested have a backdoor that 
allows them to access data.</p><p>If you think you are better at securing information than a government is at collecting it, you are very proud and very mistaken.</p>

<p>Dina, I would be a fool to think that I could implement better 
security than any state actor and I do not think that I implied that 
anywhere</p><p>I do have enough sense to not display things that I want 
private in a public forum, and I do have a fair idea what a public forum
 is</p><p>Just my opinion, but I believe that most of the intent of the 
snowden 'revelations' was to get younger voters (who had little idea of 
existing state security processes) to become disconnected from the 
political process by angering them with normal state business</p><p>If 
they were paying attention they would know that the Obama administration
 has prosecuted people who have misused the intelligence apparatus and 
placed more judicial oversight in place then existed under the prior 
administration. Sadly, that has not been part of the popular dialogue, 
which has consisted of 'OMG look what they are doing, those rats are all
 the same!!!'</p><p>You may notice that in the last election young voters were largely missing while the older republican base kept right on voting</p>

<p>@ sickofstupid He is bringing more legitimate journalism to americans
 than fox can muster in a decade. He is part way into his second season,
 and averaged over 4million views an episode for the first season, dont 
think hbo would keep him if it wasnt a successful launch. In regards to 
this weeks episode, This is something that people have just turned 
glassy eyed over. I just hope 215 or the whole patriot act gets 86d, and
 that will only happen if it gets enough media attention.</p>

<p>Thats not a set of facts, rather its a statement of opinion. He did a
 piece on civil forfeiture that no other outlet compared with, and not 
long after there was reform on that subject. Regardless of your opinion 
of his character and personality. It is effective</p>

<p>Yes, that is an opinion.  It wasn't intended to be facts.  <br>You 
didn't give any facts about civil forfeiture laws or alleged changes.  
But your opinion is that Oliver is "effective."  I don't see any facts 
of that.  And everything he says is long on opinion and short on facts.<br>You
 can't seriously call Oliver a "serious journalist."  He is by his own 
admission a comedian.  And everything he says and does is very strongly 
far left and political.  He is pushing an agenda.  It's popular with a 
small audience of people who share his viewpoints.  If you think he's a 
journalist, and especially a "serious journalist," you don't understand 
journalism.</p>

<p>My problem is that I get my facts from sources like washington post, 
and rollingstone? Where do you get your info on snowden? So you refute 
any satire based news source, and us based news source? The point is 
there are policy changes, that much is true, and since civil forfeture 
has been gaining power since the onset of the war on drugs this is the 
first meaningful challenge to the use of the law in a long time. BTW 
where and when did you find out how civil forfeture funds were being 
used? sources?</p>

funny if it jumped up and bit them in the ass.  Saying something isn't

<p>You have no case to rest upon. The fact that people in this country 
can get more legitimate news and information about things from people 
earning a living as comedians, than they can from "legitimate 
journalists" shows how deep this country's problems lay.  The fact that 
you think only reaching 4 million viewers is unimportant shows it even 
more.</p><p>4 million people watching his program each week, and who 
knows how many more via YouTube or other sources?  Let's compare those 
numbers:</p><p>New York Post - 1.37 million circulation<br>Wall Street Journal - 2.4 million circulation<br>Washington Post - 0.4 million circulation<br>Time Magazine - 3.3 million circulation<br>Newsweek - 1.5 million circulation<br>USA Today - 1.7 million circulation</p><p>Just based on this one post, one must assume that you are very sick of yourself.</p>

<p>Got some news for ya.  If I get news from the internet once per day, 
or from a newspaper once per day, the level of relevancy is pretty much 
identical.  The fact that one of those forms might be up to 24 hours 
older than the other is in itself irrelevant, and not everybody wants to
 do their reading off a computer screen. (I rather enjoy it myself, 
since I got a tablet PC.)  Now answer this; of all the people who get 
their info from that dinosaur format, and all the people who get theirs 
from the hipster format; which group has the greater voter population 
involved in the business of keeping politics and capitalism running in 
the screwed-up way that we're stuck with?</p><p>So 4 million viewers 
getting some sort of news/info from a comedian is unimpressive, but 1 
million people getting daily info from a conspiracy theorist is 
massively impressive?  The reality is neither is likely to change 
anything in our culture, because the consumers of both are mostly 
looking for some sort of personal validation, but will not actually be 
bothered into actually doing anything that changes the status quo.  But 
at least the comedian sounds more rational.</p><p>I do agree with your 
Avatar and byline though.  Actually, we probably agree on a whole lot of
 things, except for the glass-half-full vs glass-half-empty 
perspectives.</p>

 not know what the word satire means and think that any joke with a

<p>When I talk to people they seem to take the exact same stance as 
Bradly (Chelsey) Manning. He arbitrarily released all documents without 
scope or specific intent. This was not the case for Snowden documents, 
he gave, not sold those documents to specific reporters based on 
reputation, not all of them handled all the info in the best way, but 
does that reflect snowdens intent for releasing the docs? This went so 
high up that I think he could have tried to go through official channels
 first, but he would have been likely caught and snowballed before he 
could get out what he wanted and got to say what he wanted about it.</p>
