<p>This is Isreal's greatest dream come true part of the Oded Yinon plan
 to exploit an already viciously divided Arab Moslem World along the 
lines of economy, social, politics, religion and ethnicity.</p><p>Arab 
nation turning against Arab nation while Israel is left to continue 
their large scale ethnic-genocide of the Palestinians. I truly hope the 
hadith concerning Imam Al-Mahdi is true. Seeing 4 million strong army of
 Muslims marching on the world's most terrorist organization aka Israel 
would be a more than welcome sight indeed.</p><p>Here's an excerpt from their plan:</p><p>"The
 Arab Moslem world, therefore, is not the major strategic problem which 
we shall face in the Eighties, despite the fact that it carries the main
 threat against Israel, due to its growing military might. This world, 
with its ethnic minorities, its factions and internal crises, which is 
astonishingly self-destructive, as we can see in Lebanon, in non-Arab 
Iran and now also in Syria, is unable to deal successfully with its 
fundamental problems and does not therefore constitute a real threat 
against the State of Israel in the long run, but only in the short run 
where its immediate military power has great import. In the long run, 
this world will be unable to exist within its present framework in the 
areas around us without having to go through genuine revolutionary 
changes. The Moslem Arab World is built like a temporary house of cards 
put together by foreigners (France and Britain in the Nineteen 
Twenties), without the wishes and desires of the inhabitants having been
 taken into account. It was arbitrarily divided into 19 states, all made
 of combinations of minorites and ethnic groups which are hostile to one
 another, so that every Arab Moslem state nowadays faces ethnic social 
destruction from within, and in some a civil war is already raging. Most
 of the Arabs, 118 million out of 170 million, live in Africa, mostly in
 Egypt (45 million today)."</p>

<p>Why do you Arabs not hold your own people more responsible than other
 people like Jews  who have no real incentive to treat your people with 
dignity. Last time I checked Israel does not burn its prisoners alive. 
Why is it so hard for the muslim community to call ISIS as it really is,
 a savage rogue-militia terrorist organization. You continually provoke 
Israel, tried to invade Israel and call for its destruction. Yet 
whenever the topic of ISIS comes up you use Israel as a scapegoat. HOLD 
your own PEOPLE more accountable for the inhumane actions they do 
against their own people everyday not Israel. Not just ISIS but your own
 so called "civilized" countries that oppress women and mutilate them, 
and have draconian systems of punishment. Think about why this makes 
sense.</p>

<p>this is why arabs live in a sh!thole called the middle east that can 
never be improved. because muslims like the imam above me have the 
brains of an illiterate child who cannot accept responsibility for 
literally anything and must have a boogie man to blame for every single,
 literally EVERY SINGLE challenge and obstacle they face in life. they 
literally cannot get past anything on their own or accept personal 
responsibility and MUST blame Israel, Jews, and the West for everything 
they aren't strong enough to deal with. You people are the definition of
 p(_)ssies.</p>

<p>If you could tone down your pointlessly repetitive rhetoric and kill 
the idea of unifying the Arab world with the hatred of a neighbor, you 
would have a great message.</p><p>Imagine if the leaders of Iran and 
Saudi Arabia were to join forces and cease the petty proxy wars like 
this article suggests. If the Arab/Persian/Turkish/Kurdish world could 
focus on what unites them rather than what divides them; if their 
leaders could see the benefit of lifting strict laws and investing in 
their people then they really could bring about their rebirth as a world
 power. You can have it, you just have to want it.</p>
