<p>Fracking is unbelievably unsafe as it causes widespread contamination
 of gasses and other harmful chemicals and has been found to cause small
 scale earthquakes. Basically you can destroy all the environment you 
like as long as you make enough money and pay off a few politicians.</p>

<p>thats why we all need to buy electric cars so we dont need oil 
anymore. oh crap but we still need coal to produce electricity to charge
 that car...stop the airlines! no more ocean liners! kill the space 
programs! we should all ride our bikes. but danging that also took fuel 
(oil) to extract the metals needed for the bikes. now we are down to 
walking everywhere. or using horses. im done for horses to start 
trending again.</p>

<p>Fear mongering about earthquakes?  You do know they are too small to 
damage anything at all right?  You also should know that tectonic motion
 means that pressure builds up one way or the other and you will either 
get lots of small quakes or a few really big ones.<br>Yes I know the quakes from fracking aren't tectonic and I also know that is why they are completely harmless.</p>

<p>Better him than us.<br>No matter what any limp wristed 
environmentalists do, the population of the earth will not stop 
consuming resources so either we get it from there or from somewhere 
else.<br>If this were to take place in the deep ocean that would be fine
 since almost nothing lives down there, but if this is shallow water 
mining then I can see the problem.</p>

<p>I can think of at least two mining targets right off the bat. The 
first are clathrates, little methane molecules imprisoned in ice cages, 
just lying around at the bottom of the sea. All you have to do is raise 
them to a certain depth and you've liberated clean gas for burning. The 
second, as noted indirectly, is the mass of rare earth metal found 
around "black smoker" vents. It's not just gold and copper. Some 
lanthanides fetch thousands of dollars a pound, and you're talking about
 tons of this stuff.</p>

<p>You are not a very good reader, or perhaps your comprehension is 
poor. Not a single one of the creatures mentioned in that report lives 
at 10000 feet. Not a single issue or concern outlined is an issue at 
that depth. Perhaps you didnt even read it, but that speaks to a limited
 intellect whose only real concern is its own self gratification. That 
effort has obviously failed miserably. Rather pathetic to behold really.
 Someone so dying for attention that they embarrass themselves with a 
irrelevant citation as an excuse to lob an ad hominem attack, and the 
entire train wreck falls flat anyway. </p>

<p>Gases diffuse through water.  How else does industrial pollution 
pouring into the sky get into the sea and affect the creatures in the 
report? Enormous machines digging up the ocean bed will create Co2 which
 will effect the whole biosphere. Do you think the pollution will 
miraculously hold at the 10,000 ft depth you bang on about? Stop posting
 on the interbutts with such alarming frequency and learn about how 
ecosystems work.</p>

<p>Excellent rebuttal m8. So you're arguing that the disturbing of 
countless cubic metres of rock down there wouldn't release carbon and 
other nasties into the water? I understand that the excavators 
themselves do not belch out exhaust down there by the way.</p>
