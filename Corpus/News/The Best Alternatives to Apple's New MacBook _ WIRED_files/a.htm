<p>And this: "But bro, do you even lift? At 3.48 pounds, it’s almost twice as heavy as the MacBook..."</p><p>Honestly, this is the argument? I'm sure most of us remember a time in which the lightest laptop was 7+ pounds. <br>(wasn't long ago either)</p><p>So
 ease up there, bud. I've been using the 2015 MacBook Pro for a month

still very much portable, and more than twice as useful.</p>

<p>I played with the new Macbook at an apple store.  The keyboard on it 
is...interesting.  Think typing on a touchscreen that has about a 
millimeter depth movement to it.  I wouldn't want to use it for any 
length of typing.  I own the MS Surface 3, and I like the keyboard.  It 
has just enough travel and feedback, and the strokes are positioned in a
 way that can make for really speedy and accurate typing.  The thing 
that I highly dislike about the Surface 3 is that trackpad.  I hate it. 
 most of the time when I want to right click it thinks I just clicked, 
and the other time, it right clicks when I want to click.</p><p>Comparing
 the Surface 3 to the new Macbook is a bit of a joke.  In terms of just 
about everything, I would put the Surface 3 above the new Macbook. That 
being said? That Macbook is sleek and looks really nice.  For the price 
and if I wanted to stay Apple, I would spend a couple hundred more and 
get the 13" Macbook Pro, because specs.</p>

<p>Every notebook is a compromise by definition, a compromise between 
power, weight and battery life. This particular Mac has been designed 
for people who want something as light and thin as possible, but with an
 excellent screen ... everything else is secondary. The MBP is the one 
you take if weight is not such an issue. That is why they are even 
priced the same at entry level.</p>

<p>Surface 3? much more powerful, lighter, thinner.  Oh, and that is at 
the base price.  Which is about $400 cheaper.  The only thing that the 
MB has over the Surface 3 is the premium Apple logo.  Oh and the touch 
pad. The screen resolution difference is like 10 pixels per inch.</p>

<p>You can get the XPS 13 with an i5 and 8 gigs of ram, which is what 
i'm using to type this right now. 1,000$, so still completely undercuts 
the Macbooks starting price. You can even bump that up to a 256gb drive,
 well still saving money.<br>Gotta say this laptops fantastic, lasted we
 about 9 - 10 hours using Illustrator, browsing the web, and watching 
video. (stopped at 13%) Keyboards a little soft, but you get used to it.
 Only downer is the trackpad, which still cant compare to an apple.</p><p>However, if you prefer OSX your better off getting a 13" MBA or a MBP.</p>

<p>Okay, guys, pretty sure if you write an article about alternatives, you actually have to start with the alternatives. haha!</p><p>I
 would say the alternative to the new Apple with no ports and terrible 
battery life is probably an ultra cheap Chromebook, something that runs 
for about $200 or so. Seriously. Not hating on Apple, just noting that 
the new thing is not worth that money.</p>

<p>The market for notebooks is extremely competitive, as you can see in 
the article, items with similar specs also have a very similar price. If
 you cannot see the difference between a product selling for $1300 and a
 product costing $200, it just means there is something that you don't 
understand. As you don't get it, you assume it is just the brand. 
Although Lenovo brand is nowhere close to Apple in chic, their price is 
still the same.</p><p>Think about it.</p>

<p>Comparing the new MB to a Bugatti Veyron would lead one to believe that the MB is actually powerful.  Which it isn't.</p><p>I
 would compare the new MB to a Toyota Prius or Nissan Leaf.  Solid 
design, not very powerful at all, but for it's purpose as a daily 
commuter, it is as powerful as it needs to be.</p><p>All of the other alternatives would be the sports cars, with the Razer Blade being the Bugatti Veyron.</p>

<p>Meh. If an "alternative" ships w/a Microsoft OS, I'm not a customer. 
It's that simple. I'm a vet of the corporate OS wars of the 90's. MSFT 
is finally reduced to a level playing field for the first time in over 
20 years, and this is one OS warrior who won't let them off the hook. In
 the world that matters, now, tablets and smart phones, MSFT is barely a
 player, no matter how many billions they spend to drive a wedge into 
that market. They should just enjoy the corporate installed base they 
have, while they still can. Dinos, etc.</p>

<p>Despite "launching" the new MacBooks in the UK on the 10th you still 
can't actually buy them as the web site states availability of 4-6 weeks
 and when you call a store they have no idea when you're going to be 
available. This makes me wonder really, what's the point of having a 
"launch" date??.. </p>

<p>I bought an acer 720 chromebook (~$320) and put ubuntu on it 
(actually on an sd card). So I have a linux laptop for $320. This is 
done with crouton so it's not dual boot, it actually uses chroot, so I 
can switch back and forth from chromeos to ubuntu without rebooting. 
crouton was developed by a google employee so it's intended for this. 
This machine weights less than 2 lbs and has six hours battery life. My 
favorite computer at the moment. It's ssd so it boots in like 5 seconds.
 If you want a super light laptop for travel or whatnot this is perfect.
 If you want to do this research first because it will effect which 
chromebook you buy.</p>

<p>To quote Balmer "It's the software, stupid!". Wired is still unable 
to fathom that what you actually use is the software and not the 
hardware. Like most people, they see the Apple design and go bananas ...
 in one direction or the other, the aesthetes go weak in the knees, the 
techies without aesthetic sense go furious.</p>

<p>Meh, the technical preview for Windows 10 gives me some hope that 
Microsoft has pulled its head out of its backside.  Plus you can also 
get the Developer Edition of the XPS 13 if you want some Linux 
yumminess.  I've found in my sysadmin role that a combination of Cygwin 
and VirtualBox is enough to get me through the day.</p>

<p>I'm happy that this solution works for you.  But cloud services can 
do much more for you.  While Apple sees it as a synching solution, 
everyone else is building services and capabilities beyond the walled 
garden (productivity tools, massive storage at low cost, access from 
anywhere or any device, support for all file types, API access to cloud 
resources, etc.).  Don't let your mindless apple loyalty blind you to 
the obvious.  Here, I'll help you out:</p><p><a href="http://www.winbeta.org/news/battle-cloud-storage-onedrive-vs-icloud-vs-dropbox-vs-google-drive-0" rel="nofollow">http://www.winbeta.org/news/ba...</a></p><p><a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/131520-which-cloud-storage-service-is-right-for-you-icloud-vs-google-drive-vs-onedrive-vs-dropbox" rel="nofollow">http://www.pocket-lint.com/new...</a></p>

<p>Thank you for the information.  Sincerely.  But what you do not 
realize, perhaps, is that 99% of the population wants a simple, 
powerful, reliable system, be it the OS, the Cloud, and Apps.  It has to
 be intuitive and compatible with the aesthetic of Steve Jobs:  
streamlined, like Japanese design motif, using the best materials and 
minimalist distraction.</p><p>The 99% do not want endless choices, ambivalent choices and learning curves.</p><p>This is want you are not understanding.  Repeat:  elegant simplicity</p>

<p>That 99% doesn't include businesses or those interested in 
productivity.  Agree, simple works for consumers who want their content 
available across devices, but corporate users want robustness, control

depending on iCloud for corporate needs the way they use Amazon (EC2),

<p>Hold a sec.  Let's go back to your OP.  You stated that "MAC OSX and 
the Cloud/Apple Eco-system. Makes all others also-rans."  I've now given
 you multiple independent proof that your statement is uninformed and 
just-plain factually WRONG.  You can rationalize Apple's poor strategy 
here all you want, but the facts remain the same -- OSX and iCloud are a
 weak cloud offering.  So much so that NOBODY uses them beyond moving 
songs and books across the walled garden of idevices.  Its great that 
you feel this is all you need (I'm sure Apple will let you know when you
 want something more powerful), but pull your head out of Apple's a** 
before you suffocate.  Again, simple works for consumers who only want 
content sync across devices -- the vast majority of people on this 
planet use devices from multiple vendors.  The vast majority of people 
on this planet, want more, and Apple's weak-sauce attempt is too little,
 too late.</p>

 you have the freedom to work with the document of your choice on the

all your presentations, spreadsheets, PDFs, images, and any other kind 
of document in iCloud. Then access them from your iPhone, iPad, iPod 
touch, Mac, or PC. You get 5GB of iCloud storage free, and other storage
 plans start at $0.99 per month.</p><p>Storing ﬁles in iCloud is simple. Just as it should be.</p><p>To
 upload your files to iCloud, simply drag them into the iCloud Drive on 
your Mac running OS X Yosemite or PC running Windows 7 or later. Or 
start a new document using an iCloud-enabled app on your iOS device. 
Then you’ll be able to access those documents from all your devices.</p><p>Edits you make on one device <br>appear on all of them.</p><p>Using
 iCloud Drive means you’ll always have access to the latest version of 
all your documents from any device. For example, you can start creating a
 presentation on your Mac at home, then make final edits and present it 
in class using your iPad. The changes you make along the way appear 
automatically on all your devices.</p><p>Start your work in one app. <br>Add the ﬁnishing touches in another.</p><p>Your
 apps can now share files, which means you can access and work on the 
same file across multiple apps. For example, you can create a drawing in
 a sketching app, then open it in a painting app to color it in. Or 
create a chart in one app and place it in a slideshow using a 
presentation app. No more making copies or importing documents from one 
app to another. It’s a whole new level of collaboration between apps.</p><p>iCloud Drive</p><p>Any kind of ﬁle. On all your devices.</p><p>Now
