<p>This article is totally ridiculous.  Transsexualism is not only 
accepted in Iran it is encouraged or even forced in some cases.  They 
view it as gay conversion therapy and all gay couples have to have one 
person have SRS to be in compliance with the law.  They even pay for 
half of it out of tax money<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transsexuality_in_Iran" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T...</a></p>

<p>Gender Reassignment is encouraged because Transexualism is frowned 
upon, to put it lightly. You have to know the nuances. Gender 
reassignment = no more penis, "full woman" =&gt; accepted in iranian 
culture. Transexual = male with artificial(or rather augmented) feminine
 features because they identify as women =&gt; Not accepted in iranian 
culture.<br>So if you're a gay man, transexual, effeminate 
man....basically any sexual identity that is not part of the narrow 
spectrum of sexual identity accepted in iran (which are women, gender 
reassigned to women and man) will draw unwanted attention, 
verbal/physical vioelence, extrem discrimination. In other words not 
considered human beings.</p>

<p>No, the T part is a harmful form of conversion therapy.  It 
flourishes in Iran, and unfortunately has gained a lot of popularity in 
our culture as well.<br>Genital mutilation is one of those old ideas 
that just does not go away for some reason and keeps popping up in 
various forms. Feminine men have always been the primary receivers of it
 just usually against their will</p>

<p>I would have thought that most fair minded people would at least 
accept Sepi's story as authentic rather than make assumptions about what
 life is like for transgender people in Iran - especially if they have 
not lived under that regime.<br>In this country, it is legal to be 
transgender and there are laws which are supposed to protect transgender
 people in employment and other spheres of life - but many transgender 
people report abuse at work, in the street and using public services.  
So most people, reading about our own protective legislation would 
assume that it is fine to be transgender in the UK - ask any trans 
person and they will tell you a different story of harassment and 
victimisation at many points in their lives.</p>

<p>Nothing about this story is authentic. Iran has the third highest 
amount of transsexuals behind Thailand and America.  More than any 
country in Europe.  It is very accepted there.  More than it should be. 
 He isn't a refugee.</p><p> He is gay man who lives in the closet 
pretending to be a woman, doesn't work, illegally entered another 
country, was homeless, became a prostitute, then found a sugar daddy (IE
 he's still a prostitute) and he's telling a sob story about  it in 
order to jump to the head of our country's immigration line ahead of 
hard working people who bring something to the table</p>

<p>All trans people are gay.  They are not all homosexual.  Gay means 
you have an abnormal amount of feminine/masculine psychology for someone
 of your gender.  You can be heterosexual and gay, it is called queer.  
Transgender/transsexual means you want to alter your body and transform 
into the opposite gender.  Being gay is what made them want to change.<br>Sexuality
 is one of the many gender specific behaviors but not all 
psychologically gender variant people display all the opposite behaviors
 seeing as how behavior and initial instinct don't always line up in 
humans</p><p>Anything else you are confused about?</p>

<p>That is not really true.</p><p>I mean, there is plenty of books you 
can/should read before saying not well thought out things like above. 
--- Gay =/= Queer. Queer is very specific. There is no quantifiable 
amount of feminine masculine or any psychology. Feminine/masculine is 
not the only gender option. To specify more Feminine/masculine  is 
culturally defined mask. It can be core of one's identity, but it really
 does not have to be. All options are possible.</p><p>Transgender does not necessarily mean that you want to alter your body.<br>Transsexual may mean that.</p><p>I mean, it is even more complex, but... you are just wrong.</p>

<p>No, queer is not a scientific term, it is a layman's term.  It means 
odd and unusual, in this context specifically with regard to gender 
behaviors.</p><p>Surely you are aware of the existence of gaydar right? 
 You realize we can easily tell that all of the other gay subgroups 
besides the T have this same psychological gender variance?  And no it's
 not a social thing, it's in there, they can see it in neurological 
studies.</p><p>Trans people have developed a form of depression called 
gender dysphoria in response to being gay and seek to transform their 
body to fit in with social norms of male and female.  Trans is 100% 
social.  Being a feminine male is biological</p><p>Anything else you are confused about?</p>

you care to read the medical literature on it you would discover that 
the condition is probably caused in uterus - read the literature and try
 and understand it without prejudice.</p>

<p>No you are incorrect again<br>As a member of the united nations they follow the ICD mental health guidelines which includes gender identity disorder.<br>But
 I do remember the political drama where your talking point comes from 
and the NHS made an official statement about changing the wording so as 
not to offend activists like yourself.  But obviously whether someone 
uses the phrase mental illness or the word "condition" because of 
political correctness does not change what is happening.  They are still
 being treated by psychiatrists and being prescribed drugs.  These 
patients have extreme depression and high rates of suicide, the doctors 
often whitewash things to avoid upsetting them, infact that's the whole 
method of treatment that is currently used, we lie to them and tell them
 are fixed and who they are supposed to be now after altering their body
 in the hopes it will help their depression.  Obviously such a treatment
 method has been largely ineffective and suicide rates remain high.</p><p>The
 literature says that transgender people don't have anything 
biologically different from the other gay subgroups which also have 
noticeable psychological variance in terms of gender.  That's how 
"gaydar" works, you can usually tell pretty easily that a boy is more 
feminine than normal.  <br>Transgender/Transsexual people have developed
 a form of depression which is characterized by them wanting to alter 
their body in radical ways in order to fit in better with our culture's 
gender binary.  <br>Being a feminine male is not considered a mental 
illness (although technically it is)  Wanting to mutilate your body in 
response is considered one in pretty much every place in the world</p>

<p>The depression and suicide rates are caused by people like yourself 
who try to present transgender people as perverts and delusional - and 
ostracise them.  Remarkably, suicide rates diminish to around the 
national average once people have transitioned and are living as their 
authentic selves (as does depression, anxiety and other related 
illnesses).<br>Once again you are completely incorrect, the medical 
literature is full of recent research that shows that there are 
differences in the brain structure of transgender people associated with
 centres in the brain that neurobiologists think are associated with 
gender identity - and it has been shown that in trans men these centres 
align with what is seen for cisgender men - similarly these centres in 
transgender women are seen to correlate with what is seen in cisgender 
women.<br>You also seem to be associating gender identity with sexual 
orientation ("....transgender people don't have anything biologically 
different from the other gay subgroups") which is completely incorrect -
 they are two completely different things.</p>

<p>Actually it is caused by people like you and all other kinds of sexists and homophobes.<br>Despite
 what you have come to believe there is nothing wrong with being a 
feminine boy.  They do not to be fixed and transformed into a girl.  Nor
 can they be.  Telling people that they can transform and encouraging 
them to do so causes lifelong problems for them.  The ones who don't 
listen to you and seek to alter their body  and live their lives in the 
closet pretending to be a woman instead of a feminine man turn out much 
better by all measure of outcomes.</p><p>And no the medical literature 
shows no such thing.  There will never be a biological condition found 
specifically for wanting to change your gender only for the 
psychological variance making you more feminine than normal.  The 
studies you are thinking of that find serotonin differences are also 
found in homosexuals without gender dysphoria.  Wanting to transform is 
an intellectual belief not a biological condition</p><p>And yes gender 
and sexual attraction are highly related.  Sexual attraction is one of 
the gender specific behaviors, but of course humans can have their 
instincts and behaviors altered by their environment.  If this was not 
possible for sexuality than paraphiias and fetishes would not exist.</p>

<p>All I can say is that you have not read the medical literature (and 
probably do not want to as you fear it might force you to change your 
viewpoint).<br>Gender identity and sexual orientation are two different 
things - you can have a gender identity as a male and be attracted to 
women (heterosexual), or to men (gay), or to both (bi-sexual) - or to 
neither (a-sexual).  Similarly for women - and remarkably, similar for 
transgender people. If gender identity was fixed with sexual orientation
 there would be no such thing as gay men, lesbians, bi-sexual or 
a-sexual people.</p>

<p>I never said all transgender people are homosexual.  But this man is.
  Not all gay people are homosexual, you can be heterosexual and gay; it
 is often called queer.  Gay means you are more feminine than normal for
 a male.  That's how gaydar works.  All transgender people are gay, 
although I suppose there might be a tiny percentage with schizophrenia 
or narcissist personality disorder instead.  These terms are not 
scientific and their meanings change all the time. Before about 1990

surgically treated patients described themselves as "satisfied" by the 
results, but their subsequent psycho-social adjustments were no better 
than those who didn't have the surgery. And so at Hopkins we stopped 
doing s*x-reassignment surgery, since producing a "satisfied" but still

<p>Those comments were quotes from respected medical professionals who 
have had years of working in this field - and to be honest, I would much
 prefer to take their word than the word of somebody who doesn't even 
understand the meaning of "gay".  Most of my gay friends would probably 
wet themselves laughing at your definition.</p>

<p>No I am not saying that (as well you know) - I am just saying that 
despite there being laws to protect transgender people, these laws are 
often flouted (more so in Iran than the UK), but to deny that 
discrimination, harassment and violence against trans people in the UK 
exists is simply inaccurate.</p>

<p>The laws in Iran are not there to protect them, they view it as conversion therapy.</p><p>Ours
 are not intended to protect them either.  We officially view 
transsexualism as a treatment method for depression and that the people 
are mentally ill.</p><p>Protecting them would be guiding them and 
supporting them in order for them to accept themselves as who they are. 
 Despite what you have come to believe there is nothing wrong with being
 a feminine boy. They don't need to be fixed nor can they be.  All they 
need is to accept themselves.  Your method of radically altering their 
body and mental state in order to get them to accept themselves has been
 clinically ineffective</p>

<p>Surely being trans-gender would be really easy in a Muslim country.  
You hook up with a gay guy and wear the burka then both are covered.  
Walking around in a Muslim country like the dude/chick in the photo is 
pretty stupid and just asking for the kind of trouble you are going to 
get.</p>

<p>The picture he was referring to was taken in Turkey; if it was taken in Iran she would undoubtedly had a hijab on.</p><p>Turkey
 is also quite accepting as well; though they are officially a secular 
nation despite  the Islamic majority.  They are also a member of NATO 
and have close ties to the EU which also influences their human rights 
policies.  Other nations with Islamic majorities or significant Islamic 
minorities such as Indonesia, India, Pakistan and Bangladesh all have a 
legally recognized third gender for transgender people.</p><p>Transphobia
 really seems be more of a Christian problems since the nations that 
report the highest amounts of anti-trans* violence all have Christian 
majorities.</p>
