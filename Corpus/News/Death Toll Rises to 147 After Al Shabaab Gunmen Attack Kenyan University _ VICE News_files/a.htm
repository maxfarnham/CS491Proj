<p>Wow, that is so stupendously childish, and I wonder if your mommy 
knows you figured out how to use her computer. And you STILL don't know 
what "addition" means, since my comment had nothing to do with addition.

and to expect a different outcome. Oh wait, that's the sign of mental 
illness. I do think you need professional help.</p>

tragedy.</p>

<p>The important difference between the recent mass shootings in Garissa
 and the mass shootings that periodically take place across the United 
States over the years is the motive. In the USA it is invariably just a 
lone, psychotic individual who wants to make a name for himself, whereas
 in Garissa the attack was carried out because of a deeply held deluded 
belief in a religious ideology. Anders Breivik, even if he is a 
Christian (which I don't think he really is) did not carry out his 
attack because of any religious convictions, but rather political ones. 
Nothing to do with Christianity. Again, Adam Lanza (even if he happened 
to be a Christian) was simply a psychotic individual, absolutely nothing
 to do with Christianity or any other religion. Islamist terrorists on 
the other hand kill because of an uncompromising, deeply held belief in a
 medieval, religious ideology. It is this strictly religious motive that
 sets them apart from any other mass shootings or terrorist attacks that
 happen around the world.</p>

<p>You are poorly informed and making excuses.   Anders Breivik wrote 
extensively about religion as a motivation for the attack.    People in 
Islam would argue the Muslims that commit violence are not true Muslims,
 have mental issues, and are doing it for politics just like you.</p>

<p>Anders Breivik was a lone psychopath whose motivation may have been 
religious in the sense that it was borne out of fear of the supposed 
"Islamification of Europe", but he did not carry out his attack because 
of any deeply held Christian beliefs of his own. If you're saying that 
Muslims that commit violence are not true Muslims and are only doing so 
because they have mental issues then I would agree with you, hence the 
word "deluded" above. The "mental issues" are these deeply held beliefs 
in an outdated, medieval ideology that I mentioned above. Nothing to do 
with politics as you say. Anders Breivik clearly also has mental issues 
but thankfully there's only one of him.</p>

<p>It's just funny listening to you childishly make excuses for the 
crimes of Christianity while putting everything about Islamic violence 
in the most negative possible light.   Fact is mass murder is a complex 
issue that all religions have a hand in.   Pretending Muslim violence is
 somehow different is just stupid.    You ever read that Bible?   The 
part about he without sin cast the first stone?    Good advice on this 
issue.   Islam has some profound problems, like all religions.</p>

<p>I can't think of a single case of mass murder being committed in the 
name of Christianity today. During the middle ages perhaps but 
thankfully most civilised people have come of age since then (which is 
why I personally would never take any advice from the Bible or any other
 religious book). Anders Breivik targeted members of a left wing 
political party because he felt their policies were too soft on issues 
of immigration and were facilitating what he called the "Islamification 
of Europe". Terrible crimes committed by a lone, disturbed individual, 
but certainly not "crimes of Christianity". I would argue that all 
organised religions are harmful, but the only religion today that has 
thousands of people committing acts of mass aggression, murder and 
genocide is Islam.</p>

<p>You only can't think of it because you are a complete idiot.   How 
about the anti-Homosexuality laws passed in Uganda?       That was right
 wing Christians from the USA helping African Christians pass laws that 
made being a homosexual illegal and punishable by the death penalty.   
That has killed people stupid.</p><p>Muslims were just ethnically 
cleansed by Christians in the Central African Republic civil war.   
God's Army and Lord's Resistance Army are two examples of two Christian 
militia groups that committed mass murder.      Ever heard of Joseph 
Kony?     He's a Christian mass murderer.   George W. Bush is a 
Christian who says God talks to him who invaded Iraq for no reason and 
killed millions of people.   American generals and Bush said the war was
 a Christian crusade.</p><p>You are a stupid poorly informed fool.</p>

<p>If that's all you can come with then you've probably just proved my point.</p><p>The
 killings of Muslims by Christians in the Central African Republic were 
in response to the killings of Christians by the Muslim rebel group, the
 Seleka, who seized power in the country by force and appointed a Muslim
 president. The LRA started as a political movement, not a religious one
 (Kony himself may claim to be a Christian but then he claims to be many
 things). And as for Uganda, there is no death penalty there for being 
homosexual, just a lengthy prison sentence. Although since you bring it 
up, homosexuality is punishable by death in many Islamic countries, 
where the preferred method of execution is being thrown from a high 
rooftop.</p><p>So, as mentioned before, what sets the hundreds of 
thousands of Islamic extremists, intent on coordinating murder and 
genocide across the world today, apart from any other group is their 
strictly religious motivation - a deluded and unshakeable belief in 
medieval ideology.</p>

<p>Hundreds of people die from gun violence everyday right here in the 
beautiful United States of America. Not all are "mass shootings", but if
 you can't see why I would bring up my first point about how smart you 
sounded see my other post above. There is reason for comparison.</p><p>Muslims
 have no monopoly on violence by any means, as you seem to suggest. As 
you point out, "Muslims kill thousands every day", most of which are 
indeed other Muslims, naturally since you have several wars currently 
ongoing in regions that are predominantly Islamic. Never mind that the 
terrorists organizations we know of number in the thousands while the 
Muslim population of the world numbers in the billions.</p><p>Did you 
know that Latin America, a region dominated by Christians (not 
Muslims?!) has about 1/3 of the worlds violent murders despite having 
less than 10% of the world's population. Honduras has the highest murder
 rate per capita (Guatemala and El Salvador are not far behind), while 
Ciudad Juarez (literally a stone's throw from the US) had more murders 
than Mogadishu and Kabul while those cities were considered war zones.</p><p>So
 how am I a dumb little tool for suspecting that lunatics, guns, 
vulnerable targets, and tragedy are the commonalities, whereas Islam 
might be a secondhand factor at best?</p>

<p>Do you have other stats? My numbers on Central America come from the 
Organization of American States. Matter of fact I was personally 
responsible for contacting national governments and compiling the data 
myself while I worked in the department of multilateral security.</p><p>The US numbers on the other hand are well known and can be found through the Justice Department via the FBI.</p><p>You
 think because you call my stats bogus makes them bogus? I take any 
stats with a grain of salt, but the FBI and OAS are top notch 
organizations, and I'll take their numbers over your, umm, 
"observations" from living there (I have also lived in the US and spent 
considerable time in Central America).</p><p>Keep calling me a tool 
though. Might make me stupider. If it doesn't though, I'm going to keep 
kicking your @$$ with actual information.</p>

<p>I have two passports, one American and one Italian. Plenty of stamps,
 including El Salvador, Guatemala, and Belize. Honduras and Costa Rica 
are on the bucket list. That is just Central America.</p><p>Not a pubic sector employee. That was an internship when I was 18 years old. Didn't take a dime from you.</p><p>I'm
 an entrepreneur and a producer. I have my own restaurant and employ 
about 30 other people. I also sit on the board of a nonprofit that puts 
poor kids, especially females, into high school, so they too can avoid 
being on the public purse.</p><p>I don't understand why you living in 
Central America has any relevance, except that you clearly stick your 
head in the sand all the time if you are unaware of the violence around 
you.</p><p>You've tried to change the conversation from your (nonsense) 
argument that violence is only exhibited by Muslims to why I am not 
credible, but you've only helped me.</p><p>Who are people going to 
listen to reading our posts after the fact? The articulate person who is
 clearly self-made and has plenty of facts to go along with his argument
 (regardless of whether people fully agree or not) or the sketchy baby 
picture who hails insults around and think public employees are a bad 
thing by nature?</p><p>Please though, continue your rant...</p>

<p>unintentional civilian deaths vs. blatant slaughter of the innocent 
for various "religious" reasons... difference??  Although I'm not a 
supporter of over 50% of law enforcement, American media blows things 
out of proportion when they get good ratings.  If 100 people died from 
law enforcement in the U.S. in march alone, 99 of those 100 were 
actively shooting at an officer or were prepared to create harm upon 
others or that officer.</p>

<p>"Unintentional civilian deaths", now that sounds nice. It's almost 
synonymous with "collateral damage", but that also contains destruction 
of important civil infrastructure. In their more narrow usage, as you 
did above, they are both very good at distracting from what they 
actually mean: the slaughter of innocents. The "only" difference is the 
willfulness, but I'm sure it's important to you whether innocent people 
are murdered or whether they are just roadkill.....</p>

<p>Catholics didn't protest when their church was revealed to be an 
international pedophile ring.    There was zero protests by Christian 
religious groups when Christian mass murderer Anders Breivik killed a 
bunch of children.   No Christians condemned Christian mass murders like
 Eric Rudolph.</p>
