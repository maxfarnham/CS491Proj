police murder innocent people and frame them?" This is not the first

<p>The cop didn't drop the taser next to Scott's body, you can see it 
dragging behind Scott as he runs away. Slager tased Scott, it had no 
effect, and Scott took off dragging the taser behind him by the wires. 
Scott could have stopped and picked up the taser, and fired it's unused 
cartridge back at Slager, or just made off with Slager's taser. Either 
way, Scott was resisting arrest, and running away with a Cop's weapon.</p>

<p>When shot with a police taser, the darts embed in the body and remain
 connected via wires to a charged cartridge that disconnects from the 
taser gun. This cartridge, still connected to Scott via the wires,  is 
what you see trailing Scott at the end of second 19, end of second 20, 
and throughout second 21.  You can also clearly see at the end of second
 18 the taser gun rolling on the ground BEHIND Slager after Slager 
ditches the taser for his pistol.  At the middle of second 60, you can 
also see there in nothing in Slager's right hand (he has holstered his 
pistol). At the end of second 68, you see Slager pick up something 
(video is too blury to say concretely, but without a doubt it's his 
discarded taser gun)  from the ground at the original shooting point 
with his right hand. At second 82 and 83 you can clearly see now a black
 object in Slager's right hand (obviously it's the taser he picked up at
 second 68).  At the very end of second 91, you clearly see the black 
object in Slager's right hand. At the very beginning of second 92 you 
see Slager's right hand is now empty and the black object is now falling
 towards Scott.</p>

<p>Some of you are missing the point of this article. A police officer 
killed someone and lied to justify the killing. A video shows police 
officer was in no danger. I think some of you didn't read all the way 
through. The significance is that a cop planted evidence to make him 
seem innocent. </p>
